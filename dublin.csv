Ard released his debut solo album ‘First Offerings’ in the winter of 2012 to critical acclaim and continues to write and release under his name, as well as fronting Just Jinjer.<p>Over the course of the last decade and a half, well known singer and songwriter, Ard Matthews, has been honing his craft and moving people the world over. As the front man of South African band Just Jinjer, his indelible lyrics and melody arrangements led the way to the incredible success of their debut album title ‘All Comes Round’, becoming one of the biggest selling rock genre albums of all time in their native country of South Africa, achieving<br> double platinum status in it’s first year, with the follow up album “Something for now” reaching the same status a year later.<br> Just Jinjer have shared the stage with many iconic local and international artists on many stages across the world. Most notably at the Nelson Mandela 46664 Concert, Johannesburg in 2009 where they performed with the likes of The Goo Goo Dolls, Annie Lennox, Razorlight, Ludacris, Corrinne Bailey Rae, Peter Gabriel, Live, and Angélique Kidjo. They have also performed support duties, and shared the bill with many international stars such as U2,<br> Counting Crows, Def Leppard, INXS, Maroon 5, One Republic, Hootie and the Blowfish, The Strokes, and many more. On their own, Just Jinjer have performed many sold out arena<br> Ard was born in Johannesburg to Dries Brits and Arlene, but considers himself a Durban boy after having moved to the Bluff in Durban shortly thereafter, to be raised by only his mother.<p>He grew up in a strict religious household with little popular music, but what he did hear Nat “King” Cole, Louis Armstrong and Elvis Presley — elicited an innate musicality that won him a talent contest as a singer when he was twelve years old.<p>In his late high school years, he sat down at a friend’s drum kit and immediately found a natural proficiency on percussion. Having no desire to pursue conventional studies after school, he enrolled in to The Groove Class based in Johannesburg, South Africa’s only<br> affiliate of Los Angeles’s famed Musicians Institute, during which time he also started to learn the guitar and discovered a voice that would shape the course of his future forever.<p>Travelling frequently to countries all over the world with Just Jinjer, Ard and the band wowed audiences across Europe, Australia, and the United States, and eventually settled in Los Angeles for 8 years, where they signed an international recording deal with Curb Records, and played at some of the most well known and influential clubs and festivals before returning to SA in 2009.<p>Ard released his debut solo album ‘First Offerings’ in the winter of 2012 to critical acclaim and shortly after teamed up with South African folk icon Vusi Mahlasela for Ard’s single ‘Umuntu’,<br> as well as famed composer and performer Paul Hepker (Oscar winning movie Tsotsi, as well as composer for Deadliest Catch, Rendition, & Eye in the Sky soundtracks) for Jeff Buckley’s<br> ‘Lover, You should have come over’. Ard is now playing regularly as a solo act, as well as still fronting the original Just Jinjer, both playing at well known festivals such as Oppikoppi and<br> Rocking The Daisies, and other high profile venues.<br> In 2014, Ard joined forces with top advertising company King James and leading insurance firm Sanlam to produce a massive online campaign about a snubbed contestant from an international music contest television series, with Ard writing, producing, and recording a song for the contestant and being filmed for a documentary.<p>Ard recently returned from a string of sold out international shows in the United Kingdom & Dubai, and during the end of 2016 completed a brand new single entitled ‘Wonder Years’, a genre crossover track incorporating Pop, Indie, and Dance, due for release in the first week of 2017, and featured on MNET’s Prime-Time television show Arno Carstens & Friends.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-100478493-1,[None],53.3466761,,-6.2632464,2017-02-18 00:24:21,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,Dublin 1,1,,D,Dublin,2017-08-05 20:00:00,,Ard Matthews Live In Dublin.,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/ard-matthews-live-dublin-/E0-001-100478493-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,35 Lower Liffey Street,1,V0-001-004645599-7,The Grand Social (Formerly Pravda),http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-grand-social-formerly-pravda-/V0-001-004645599-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Acclaimed pianist and master tutor of the Deeper Piano Studies method, Frederic Chiu brings you an exhilarating twist on a piano recital - Frenchman Claude Debussy with his dreamy, impressionistic technique and use of the Lydian mode, versus the percussive virtuosity of Prokofiev.    Two composers who couldn’t be on more opposite ends of the scale, from an era where concert music was high-stakes, spirit-stirring stuff. Who will you choose? This thrilling show is not your average piano recital, the audience will be engaged and excited, and perhaps their loyalties will be tested. From Debussy’s Rêverie to Prokofiev’s Toccata and everything in between, this promises to be a fantastic, fun-filled music experience for all ages.    Over the course of the festival, some lucky music students from our Summer Academy will also get the chance to learn under Chiu’s acclaimed teaching program, Deeper Piano Studies. The method has been presented at the Juilliard School and the Banff centre among other prestigious institutions of study. The novel approach to piano teaching includes learning collaboration and competition through cooking challenges and sensory games, and has been widely acclaimed.    Influenced by greats like Glenn Gould and Vladimir Horowitz from a young age, Chiu has performed in esteemed venues like the Kennedy Centre in Washington, The Chatelet in Paris and the iconic Lincoln Centre in New York. He frequently collaborates on various vibrant live piano experiences with musicians like Joshua Bell, Bob James and Pierre Amoyal to name but a few.   Chiu has released over 27 recordings, including the most extensive, complete piano works of Prokofiev, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel, Mendelssohn among other classical geniuses.",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103739053-6,[None],53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-12 08:25:09,Europe/Dublin,pianofestival,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-23 12:00:00,2017-07-23 13:00:00,"Frederic Chiu, piano | 'Classical Smackdown'",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackdown-/E0-001-103739053-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

42,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-04-18 12:45:54," Developmental Attunement, Relational-Needs and Therapeutic Presence A one-day training workshop at Dublin on Relational Psychotherapy with Dr Richard G. Erskine DUBLIN, 13 NOVEMBER 2017, MONDAY 10:00 – 17:00  “The healing of cumulative neglects, traumas, and attachment disruptions occurs through a contactful therapeutic relationship” A contact-oriented and Relational psychotherapy through inquiry, attunement and involvement responds to the client’s current needs for an emotionally nurturing relationship that is reparative and sustaining. The aim of such therapy is the integration of the affect-laden experiences and an intrapsychic reorganization of the client’s beliefs about self and others while acknowledging, validating and normalizing the client’s essential relational needs. As therapists, how do we allow affective, behavioural, cognitive and physiological dimensions to inform our therapeutic direction while effectively interpreting whether ego state regression, activation of the intrapsychic influence of introjection and presence of defence mechanisms are indications of contact deficits that seek fulfilment? At this unique and practical training workshop, Dr Richard Erskine draws on an integrative therapeutic approach and explains Relational Psychotherapy as a process of making whole: taking disowned, unaware, unresolved aspects of the ego and making them part of the cohesive self. He especially highlights how ‘developmental attunement’ is key to this reparative process – through which, we as therapists can sensitise our therapeutic responses to a client’s regression, while remaining aware that such regression allows clients to access defended memories and experience otherwise forbidden affect. Through lecture, case vignettes, videos & therapy demonstrations and clinical discussions, the workshop helps us comprehend a series of psychotherapeutic methods that include: the creation of interpersonal contact; the formation of a healing relationship;  the therapeutic use of phenomenological inquiry; the relational centrality of attunement to the client’s affects and rhythm; the timing of relational-inquiry; the significance of resonating with the client’s level of emotional development; the affirming use of acknowledgement, validation, and normalization; the distinction between a reactive and responsive countertransference; the centrality of therapeutic presence Keeping in mind the therapeutic challenges we face as psychotherapists, psychologists, counsellors and psychiatrists, Richard describes the Eight Relational-Needs essential for human development and wellbeing. He focusses on the centrality of an involved therapeutic relationship while emphasizing the in-depth methods of a psychotherapy that integrates the client&#39;s affect, cognition, physiology and behaviour.  © nscience UK ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102222161-2,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3394027,,-6.2614196,2017-06-24 04:50:35,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-11-13 10:00:00,,"Developmental Attunement, Relational-Needs and Therapeutic Presence",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-the-/E0-001-102222161-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,128 Saint Stephen's Green,1,V0-001-006930808-7,The Fitzwilliam Hotel,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-fitzwilliam-hotel-/V0-001-006930808-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Acclaimed pianist and master tutor of the Deeper Piano Studies method, Frederic Chiu brings you an exhilarating twist on a piano recital - Frenchman Claude Debussy with his dreamy, impressionistic technique and use of the Lydian mode, versus the percussive virtuosity of Prokofiev.    Two composers who couldn’t be on more opposite ends of the scale, from an era where concert music was high-stakes, spirit-stirring stuff. Who will you choose? This thrilling show is not your average piano recital, the audience will be engaged and excited, and perhaps their loyalties will be tested. From Debussy’s Rêverie to Prokofiev’s Toccata and everything in between, this promises to be a fantastic, fun-filled music experience for all ages.    Over the course of the festival, some lucky music students from our Summer Academy will also get the chance to learn under Chiu’s acclaimed teaching program, Deeper Piano Studies. The method has been presented at the Juilliard School and the Banff centre among other prestigious institutions of study. The novel approach to piano teaching includes learning collaboration and competition through cooking challenges and sensory games, and has been widely acclaimed.    Influenced by greats like Glenn Gould and Vladimir Horowitz from a young age, Chiu has performed in esteemed venues like the Kennedy Centre in Washington, The Chatelet in Paris and the iconic Lincoln Centre in New York. He frequently collaborates on various vibrant live piano experiences with musicians like Joshua Bell, Bob James and Pierre Amoyal to name but a few.   Chiu has released over 27 recordings, including the most extensive, complete piano works of Prokofiev, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel, Mendelssohn among other classical geniuses.",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103739053-6,[None],53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-12 08:25:09,Europe/Dublin,pianofestival,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-23 12:00:00,2017-07-23 13:00:00,"Frederic Chiu, piano | 'Classical Smackdown'",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackdown-/E0-001-103739053-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

This masterclass has a limited number of spaces for agencies, consultants and unions.  If you work for an agency or a union, or are a consultant, please book the appropriate ticket.  Space is limited at this event and priority is given to charities, so some non-charity bookings will have to go on a waiting list. Can political parties attend? Charities get priority but we may be able to provide one or two spaces for representatives from progressive political parties. Please contact the organisers at hello@irishcharitylab.org to request a place. What&#39;s the refund policy? As we are a small non-profit organisation with limited resources, we ask that if you need to cancel your booking, you give us enough time to re-sell your ticket.

If you need to cancel and request a refund, you can do so through EventBrite. If you need to cancel at short notice, you can transfer your ticket to a colleague. Is it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn&#39;t match the person who attends? Please fill out the name(s) of the actual attendee(s) rather than the person booking the ticket. If you need to transfer your ticket to a colleague, that is no problem - you can change the name on your ticket by following these instructions. Is there a limit on the number of people that can attend from my organisation? Yes – you can send up to three people from your organisation. We restrict tickets to three per organisation to ensure that there’s a diverse mix of people at each event, and also so that as many organisations as possible have the opportunity to attend.

He realized that the new data-driven, tech savvy techniques he was implementing were lightyears ahead of plain traditional marketing, and thus needed a new name (terrible name if you ask me, but we are stuck with it!).

89,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-15 23:25:07," https://youtu.be/rIaZ8QnmdOc A piano recital like you’ve never witnessed before will take place on July 23rd at the Hugh Lane Gallery, as part of The Dublin International Piano Festival 2017. Acclaimed pianist and master tutor of the Deeper Piano Studies method, Frederic Chiu brings you an exhilarating twist on a piano recital - Frenchman Claude Debussy with his dreamy, impressionistic technique and use of the Lydian mode, versus the percussive virtuosity of Prokofiev. Two composers who couldn’t be on more opposite ends of the scale, from an era where concert music was high-stakes, spirit-stirring stuff. Who will you choose? This thrilling show is not your average piano recital, the audience will be engaged and excited, and perhaps their loyalties will be tested. From Debussy’s Rêverie to Prokofiev’s Toccata and everything in between, this promises to be a fantastic, fun-filled music experience for all ages. Over the course of the festival, some lucky music students from our Summer Academy will also get the chance to learn under Chiu’s acclaimed teaching program, Deeper Piano Studies. The method has been presented at the Juilliard School and the Banff centre among other prestigious institutions of study. The novel approach to piano teaching includes learning collaboration and competition through cooking challenges and sensory games, and has been widely acclaimed. Influenced by greats like Glenn Gould and Vladimir Horowitz from a young age, Chiu has performed in esteemed venues like the Kennedy Centre in Washington, The Chatelet in Paris and the iconic Lincoln Centre in New York. He frequently collaborates on various vibrant live piano experiences with musicians like Joshua Bell, Bob James and Pierre Amoyal to name but a few. Chiu has released over 27 recordings, including the most extensive, complete piano works of Prokofiev, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel, Mendelssohn among other classical geniuses.  ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103827801-9,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-23 21:38:03,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-23 12:00:00,,"Concert #2 of 6 | Frederic Chiu, piano | 'Classical Smackdown: Debussy vs. Prokofiev'",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smac-/E0-001-103827801-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

It does not mean changing the way we work, it means being able to clearly articulate why our work meets our customers’ needs.We help you to work out a clear Value Proposition, to understand “they” perspective. We will lead the whole process and provide you with the tools and feedback you need. You will get a chance to apply the newest entrepreneurial techniques (i.e. Creative Business Model Canvas), and to discuss your ideas and challenges with us and a small group of other photographers developing their own endeavours and who are always happy to share their experiences.Where appropriate we will look at your Value Propositions not only from a business but also from the social and cultural perspective.What You Will Need•        Materials will be provided.What Will You Learn:1.      What is Value Proposition and how do you test and refine your specific Value Proposition?2.      Who are the right customers you need to reach and engage to grow your business?3.      What are the needs and problems your customers need solving the most?4.      How do you effectively communicate your Value Proposition to your customers?5.      Is your business scalable?

CSMs understand Scrum values, practices, and applications and provide a level of knowledge and expertise above and beyond that of typical project managers. CSMs act as &quot;servant leaders,&quot; helping the rest of the Scrum team work together and learn the Scrum framework. CSMs also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. To earn your CSM certificate, you must take a CSM course from a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) or Endorsed Scrum Trainer (EST) and demonstrate your progress through our online CSM test. The first step toward your CSM is familiarizing yourself with Scrum. Then attend an in-person, two-day (16 hour) CSM course taught by a Scrum Alliance Authorized Trainer. After successfully completing the course, you will need to pass the CSM exam. To get a passing score, you must correctly answer 24 of the 35 questions.  You will be eligible for 16 Scrum Education Units (SEUs) upon completion of this course. After you pass the CSM exam, you will be asked to accept the License Agreement and complete your Scrum Alliance membership profile.

102,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-17 02:38:11," With over 1000 Irish students now registered on degree programmes, taught through English, in Dutch universities, the universities themselves are starting to notice.  On foot of a recent series successful OMG events, accross the country, organised by EUNiCAS, fifteen Dutch universities are visiting Cork, to speak to prospective Irish students and their families. Importantly, Irish students, currently studying in the Netherlands, will be available for a chat on the night.So why the Netherlands? Guy Flouch of the Irish-based EUNiCAS application support service, comments that: “Dutch Research Universities and Universities of Applied Sciences have a very high global reputation. Despite that, they are not particularly interested in your Leaving Cert points [or your grades, for postgraduate progrmmes] for entry, since they embrace the notion of you having a &quot;right to an education&quot;. Tuition Fees which, at EUR2006, are already very low, can be recouped by way of a low-interest loan from the Dutch government. Add to that, the attractiveness of graduates from these institutions, to employers, in an increasingly globalised employment market, it is definitely worth thinking about” Speaking at the event, in addition to representatives of the universities, and their students, will also be the Dutch Embassy and mulinational employers.Subject areas offered by these institutions, at both undergraduate and postgraduate level, include International Law, Psychology, Physiotherapy, Business, Game Design, Medicine, Public Health, Pharmacy, Biomedicine, International Relations/European Studies, Languages, Natural Sciences, Computer Science, Engineering, Hotel Management, Music, Fine Art and many more Schedule:18.30 - 19.30 Exhibition of participating universities, giving you an opportunity to discuss with them, informally, their programmes and admissions procedures.19.30 - 20.30 Presentations on Global Employment Opportunities and Studying in the Netherlands, including Q&A with Irish students currently studying in the Netherlands20.30 - 21.30 Further opportunity to meet universities 1:1. Guidance CounsellorsCounsellors are welcome to attend main event. They can also book for a preliminary series of 1:1 briefings with the universites (from17.30), which will give them an opportunity to quiz them (and their students) about the opportunities they are offering.

106,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-12 08:26:59,"Now in its 5th year, Dublin International Piano Festival is making a welcome return this July with a stellar programme sure to delight music lovers. To mark the beginning of a wonderful and diverse lineup of performances, workshops, and events, The Hugh Lane will host a Schubertiade on July 22nd - celebrating the pivotal works of Franz Schubert.  The festival’s Artistic Director and founder Dr Archie Chen will be joined by Evelyne Brancart Professor of Music (Piano) at Indiana University School of Music in Bloomington for a special recital. Together, they will bring some of Schubert’s most exhilarating work to life, setting the tone for 2017’s festival.  Described by the Irish Times as a pianist who performs with “… gorgeously full tone and daring velocity… ” Chen has gained international recognition for his poetic imagination, drama and virtuosic technical prowess. Co-founder and Director of Development at the Piano Academy of Ireland, Dr. Chen has performed in esteemed venues including Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Centre, Vatican Auditorium and concert halls throughout China. Among other prizes during his eclectic career, he was awarded Artist of the Year by the New York Classical Music Society in 2013. As well as his solo and chamber work, Chen has performed with the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, Washington Symphony and the Northwest Chamber Orchestra among many others. A new disc of Liszt & Chopin is forthcoming from Chen on Carnegie Artists.  Belgium-born Brancart made her debut in Alice Tully Hall in 1982, with a memorable performance of Chopin 24 etudes and Brahms Paganini Variations. A respected musician and academic, she has performed with high-calibre artists like Joshua Bell and Miriam Fried, and is renowned for her masterclasses which she has held around the globe, from Los Angeles and Chile to right here in Ireland. Brancart has taught previously at The University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, Rice University in Houston and San Francisco Conservatory of Music among others. Her extensive discography is available from Deutsche Gramophon, Boston Records and Decca to name but a few.   Join Brancart and Chen as they perform Fantasie in F minor and Sonata for Piano Duet in C major, ‘Grand Duo’, D. 812. Regarded as one of the most prolific and innovative composers of the early 19th century, the music of Schubert performed live will be a delight for musicians and fans alike.",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103739105-8,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/715/460-3.jpeg_/archie-chen-evelyne-brancart-piano-duo-schuberti-60.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/715/460-3.jpeg_/archie-chen-evelyne-brancart-piano-duo-schuberti-60.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/715/460-3.jpeg_/archie-chen-evelyne-brancart-piano-duo-schuberti-60.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/715/460-3.jpeg_/archie-chen-evelyne-brancart-piano-duo-schuberti-60.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-12 08:26:59,Europe/Dublin,pianofestival,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-22 13:00:00,2017-07-22 14:30:00,"Archie Chen & Evelyne Brancart, piano duo | 'Schubertiade'",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/archie-chen-evelyne-brancart-piano-duo-schuber-/E0-001-103739105-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,
107,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-15 23:26:56," Dublin International Piano Festival 2017 is proud to present a magnificent afternoon of music with the one and only Gabriele Baldocci on July 28th. One of the highlights of this year’s program, the chosen pieces reflect the power, passion, and conflict of Tolstoy’s epic 1869 classic. A renowned conductor, Baldocci has given concerts in a myriad of venues; from Zurich’s Tonhalle and the Parco Della Musica in Rome to the Teatro Fraschini in Pavia. As a pianist, he has been on the bill for festivals in Denmark, Argentina and many more. His performances are regularly broadcast on television and radio, with Italian network Classica producing a documentary about his storied career. His recordings are available on esteemed labels Stradivarius and Dynamic. This is set to be an unmissable event in the company of the Italian, described by Gramophone Magazine as ‘a pianist of formidable capabilities’. Only  a musician of his calibre would begin a recital with the technically demanding Lizst transcription of Beethoven’s 5th symphony. Composed as the Napoleonic Wars ravaged Europe, Beethoven himself was tormented by increasing deafness during its creation. Following this tour de force is a piece from the iconic Frenchman, Maurice Ravel. La Valse (The Waltz), was his tribute to the elegance and suggestive sensuality of the Viennese ballroom dance. This hypnotic and thrilling work was also said to be an incisive comment on the chaos in Europe following the Great War. The closing piece of this event is from Russian great Kabalevsky, who was one of the leading figures in Soviet era classical music. Piano Sonata no. 3 evokes the era of Tolstoy’s masterwork and is the perfect thematic closure to the recital. Piano Sonata no. 3 is one of the most complex of Kabalevsky’s works, and reflects the patriotism and conflict present during a trying period in the country’s history. The beautiful Hugh Lane Gallery plays host to this unforgettable experience, where the audience will be immersed in a rousing and passionate performance of some outstanding works of art.

185,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-07-04 10:46:21," Experience Dublin on an interactive sonic bike as part of our current exhibition SOUND CHECK. Book in for a free sonic bike experience.   Ya slip ta bang is an interactive composition mapped over the streets of Dublin that will unfold for visitors as they ride &#39;sonic bikes&#39; along specific routes of the city. Accompanied by electronic music, the composition tells the story of recovering heroin addict Lucy Dolan as she returns to the city, revisiting important places in her life. The sonic bike is a bicycle with frame-mounted speakers that plays different sounds and music dependent on where the cyclist goes and how fast they ride, via a mounted location-sensitive system. Ya slip ta bang is the first collaboration between London-based composer Kaffe Matthews and author Mia Gallagher. The text is from Mia’s debut novel HellFire. See here for more information about the artists Kaffe Matthews and Mia Gallagher. Please note that bikes will not be issued to visitors if it is raining. We apologise for any inconveniences this may cause - the bikes were not designed with Irish weather in mind! FAQ What happens if it’s raining? If it is raining at all, the bikes will not be issued to visitors. If it is raining, there is no need to turn up for your booking.  If you are unsure if your booking will go ahead due to weather conditions, please email Science Gallery Dublin at info@dublin.sciencegallery.com to check.  If the booking can’t go ahead due to weather conditions you may re-book the following Monday. Do I need to book a bike in advance of my visit to Science Gallery Dublin? We strongly recommend pre-booking as there is a high demand for the tour. If you come to the gallery without pre-booking we can not guarantee any of the bikes will be available. How much does the experience cost? It’s free. However you will need to leave a non-monetary deposit (such as a credit card, car keys, or a government issued photo ID such as a passport or a driver’s licence). Do I need to sign any forms? Yes, you will need to sign a loan form when you arrive for your booking at Science Gallery Dublin. Are there minimum age requirements to hire the bike? Yes, you must be 15 years or older.  Please bring an ID with you. For 15 to 17-year-olds, please have your parent or guardian print and fill out a consent form before you arrive at Science Gallery.  Click here to download the consent form.  What is included in the bike hire? The bike hire includes a sonic bike with a bell, front and rear lights, safety equipment, a safety briefing, a map and advice from our mediator staff. Where do I pick up the bike? You will pick up the bike on the ground floor of Science Gallery Dublin from a mediator stationed at the Sonic Bike exhibit. How long does the tour last? It depends on your chosen route, with the short taking 30 minutes and the longer route taking roughly an hour.  Bikes should be returned within an hour to where you picked them up at Science Gallery Dublin. Will there be a tour guide? No.  You will be provided with a map. You will be briefed by a mediator on using the bike and the route. What time do I arrive at for my booking? Please arrive five minutes early. What happens if I’m late? If you are over 15 minutes late for your booking, the bike will be offered to another visitor. What if I can’t attend and need to re-book a time-slot? If you can’t attend, please cancel your booking through Eventbrite as early as possible, and rebook for a later date that suits you better. Bookings are released on a weekly basis each Monday.    What clothing should I wear for the tour?

Over the two days of the 15th & 16th July in St Anne&#39;s Park lots of fun for all the family will be taking place at the annual event hosted by Dublin City Council events. Online places are limited! However, there is also an option to book with us on the day of the event at the venue. The School of Irish Archaeology is proud to introduce their finest product the Big Dig! The replica ‘Viking House’ workshop and excavation is designed around children from 5 – 12 years of age. This innovative product allows children to explore the Viking world through a simulated and controlled archaeology dig. Children have an opportunity to experience what it is like to be an archaeologist by learning how to excavate the remains of a Viking house. They will have an opportunity to dig for Viking treasures and artefacts dating back over 1000 years and learn about our Viking ancestors through the eyes of real archaeologists! We ensure this educational and one of a kind experience won’t leave your children disappointed. We guarantee it will leave them wanting to know much more about the work of archaeologists and who our ancient ancestors were!

It is human nature to fear death. Time ticks in one direction, and we can’t control that. We all want to feel accomplished before time undoubtedly stops, but what if you don’t know what you want to accomplish before that happens,” </em><p><em>“The fear of never finding out can ultimately prevent people from ever finding out. It creates this sort of feedback loop where one is using so much energy, but never actually accomplishing anything. So instead of looking forward at the unknown, people find comfort in looking back at what has already been set in their own personal timeline. I feel overwhelmed by this idea all the time, and it’s exhausting. I feel like I have to be someone I’m not just so I can be as present as possible.”</em><p><strong>PRESS QUOTES</strong><p><em>Charming and brilliant vocals are prominently displayed within the piece, with a blissful and enchanting bed of music that is layered throughout. Picking up in intensity, the song entices your ears with elements of classic Indie nostalgia, with a sugary, unique twist and Pop sensibility. Echoing harmonies are laced with a haunting string section which will make you fall in love. “If I Stare,” is a breakout single for the band, as they put their name on the map as a noteworthy and unforgettable musical force</em>.<p>– Louise Parker, Paste Magazine<br><em>As a dynamic first statement, ‘Heavy Lines’ makes a case that Happy Abandon could break through to the big stages its idols occupy</em><p>– Spencer Griffith, Indy Week<p><em>There is a strong spirit of dream pop embedded in a gutsy sound. They achieve a big sound as the production is strong as the guitars ring out steadily. It is the lead vocals that resonate profoundly, as the singer pulls and pushes his words with a dramatic flair with no shortage of grace. This is smart music, well produced, and with lots of heart.</em><p>– David Hintz, DC Rock Live<p> <p> <p><strong>Lű Tysky</strong><p> <p>Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lutysky/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/lutysky/</a><p>Photo attached<p>Soundcloud<p>– <a href=""https://m.soundcloud.com/luke-carey-903820460"" rel=""nofollow"">https://m.soundcloud.com/luke-carey-903820460</a><p> <p>Bandcamp<p>– <a href=""https://ltysky.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ltysky.bandcamp.com</a><p> <p>Spotify<p>– <a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/6rjl6Zj84S9TBf3GCdCPxY?context=spotify%3Aartist%3A6rjl6Zj84S9TBf3GCdCPxY"" rel=""nofollow"">https://open.spotify.com/artist/6rjl6Zj84S9TBf3GCdCPxY?context=spotify%3Aartist%3A6rjl6Zj84S9TBf3GCdCPxY</a><p> <p> </p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",City Based GeoCodes,,,,E0-001-101887422-2,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/255/667-5.jpeg_/happy-abandon-l%C5%B1-tysky-67.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/255/667-5.jpeg_/happy-abandon-l%C5%B1-tysky-67.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/255/667-5.jpeg_/happy-abandon-l%C5%B1-tysky-67.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/255/667-5.jpeg_/happy-abandon-l%C5%B1-tysky-67.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3416,,-6.25735,2017-04-26 11:22:33,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,01295 274100,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-06 00:00:00,,Happy Abandon + Lű Tysky,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/happy-abandon-l%C5%B1-tysky-/E0-001-101887422-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,TBC,1,V0-001-002480466-9,Dublin,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-/V0-001-002480466-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

213,2,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-17 18:02:20," <p>Aiken promotions presents<br><strong>SHAME<strong><br><p>+ special guests<br>The Workmans Club, Dublin<br>Saturday 14th October 2017<p>Shame have announced a new headline autumn UK & European tour including a stop-off at The Workman’s Club, Dublin this October.<p>“Our music is about wanting to provoke something,” says Charlie Steen, 19-year-old lead singer of London’s most talked-about young band, SHAME. “It’s not about standing onstage and singing pretty love songs. It’s about confrontation, energy, adrenaline and anarchy.”.<p>Since starting out as school boys, this five-piece band has become notorious for stealing every stage with the outrageous, jaw-dropping performances that have become the Shame signature. Their riotous two-year journey has included gate-crashing a Glastonbury stage, supporting The Fat White Family, Warpaint and Slaves, performances in Europe, Austin Texas, a nomination for best new artists at the prestigious Anchor awards, headlining their own UK tour and releasing the double A-side single, Gold Hole/The Lick.<p>Formed in the playgrounds of South London, Steen met guitarist Sean Coyle-Smith at primary school. They got together with guitarists Josh Finerty and Eddie Green at secondary school. Charlie Forbes – the drummer – was at nursery school with Green. Bonded by their precocious taste in music (one of their first gigs was supporting their hero Mark E Smith of The Fall) during their A level years they were hanging out at Stockwell’s Queen’s Head – unofficial home to The Fat White Family.<p>“We were sucked into this alternative world which just crystallised everything we thought about” says Steen. “There were drag queens and jobseekers; people who’d been in bands, like Alabama3, The Ruts, and the bassist from Stiff Little Fingers – this older generation of people and they saw a kindred spirit in this little group of schoolkid runts.” Along with the Queen’s head crew, The Fat Whites inspired and mentored them. “In a sea of mundanity the Fat Whites were exciting and dangerous,” says Steen. “It was like watching chaos explode in front of you.”<p>As their foothold in the South London scene grew, Shame instigated the daredevil club night, Chimney Shitters and creating a politically outspoken, DIY ethos reflecting a punk spirit in today’s world. “We are not puppets. Everything we do, we do ourselves,” says former Camberwell student, Steen. “From our songs to our clothes to the artwork for the singles, T-shirts, and fanzines. It’s all us.

Safe Pass is a one-day safety awareness programme which is operated by SOLAS. It is aimed at all who work on Construction sites.  The aims of the programme are to: raise the standard of safety awareness in the construction industry ensure that all site personnel after completing the one day awareness programme can make a positive contribution to the prevention of accidents and ill health while working on the site maintain a register of personnel who have received training provide participants with a Safe Pass registration card, indicating that the holder has attended a formal course in health and safety awareness Who pays for the Safe Pass course Generally the employer pays for the Safe Pass course.  The  employer under section 10,25 & 26 of Safety, Health & Welfare at Work Act, 2005 is responsible to allow employees time off from their duties for awareness training as may be reasonable having regard to their health and safety without loss of remuneration.

Health & Safety in ConstructionThe Solas SafePass Health and Safety Awareness Training Programme is to ensure that, over the course of time, all workers in construction will have a basic knowledge of health and safety, and be able to work on-site without being a risk to themselves or others who might be affected by their acts or omissions. From a health and safety perspective, construction workers are bound by law to hold a valid Safe Pass card. With this Background in mind the programme was developed in consultation with interested parties.The Aims of the programme are focused mainly around health and safety awareness, while the Benefits include an improved safety culture. There are a number of different modules making up the Safe Pass Course Content.Part 1, Section 4 of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 provides details on the categories of workers that recognise a Safety Awareness Registration Card.  Construction apprentices registered under the Standards Based Apprenticeship Scheme, and trainees undergoing traineeships in the Construction Industry are also required to have a Safety Awareness Registration Card Event cancellations : Please note that a Safe Pass course cannot run without at least 8 candidates under Solas rules.

We’re a bit older, hopefully a little wiser and it’s just like, let’s sort things out, let’s not fight about things anymore”. The video, too, is euphoric, featuring Thierry Henry, the football legend driving the pair through the neon city-scape to some life-affirming disco paradise.<p><em>Jump On Board</em> is the sound of a band totally comfortable in their own skin, bursting with great songs influenced by Northern Soul, Disco, seminal British groups like the Bee-Gees, Orange Juice and with more than a passing nod to Sharleen’s co- founder Johnny McElhone’s first band, Altered Images. In 2017 Texas are buoyed with brand new possibilities and belief in their craft, Sharleen and her musical soul-mate Johnny, two proven world-class song-writers now at the peak of their life-long game.“The passion for song-writing, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s ever been stronger than it is now,” says Sharleen. “I&#39;m more in love with it than ever.”<p><em>Jump On Board</em> began in early 2016, written and self-produced in the band’s studio in Glasgow, where the songs flowed easily, fresh ideas effortlessly chiming with Texas&#39; innate song-writing nous. “We were very conscious it wouldn&#39;t just be, &#39;hi, we&#39;re doing another Texas album&#39;,” says Sharleen. “We were aware of me singing in a different way. People know my voice, they know I can sing. But how would it be if I didn&#39;t just do me? And what happened was, with the band all having input, it was a very happy and fun record to make, we were all throwing ideas at each other. We didn’t want to go out and work with lots of different songwriters, this time we wanted it to just be us and some friends. We wanted this to feel like a record that was part of all of our collective soul, that felt free”.<p>The potential hits, from here, keep coming. Can&#39;t Control is haunting, dazzling electro-pop echoing the cinematic expanse of Lana del Rey, while the beautiful, intimate For Everything rises heavenwards to a spell-binding, gospel-backed crescendo. “It&#39;s probably the most I&#39;ve ever given lyrically in a song,” notes Sharleen.<p>Texas have never been scared of doing their own thing, a band with rare longevity, <em>Jump On Board</em> marking a distinct flair,and igniting thrilling flashes of those benchmark, beloved hits; Say What You Want, Halo, Black Eyed Boy, Summer Son, songs spanning an almost thirty year career and 40 million album sales. “It&#39;s got all those elements,” decides Sharleen, “but that wasn&#39;t what we were trying to do, I would love to think we were that clever!”<p>In 2017, Texas have never sounded more alive, a stunning British success story which is far from over yet, <em>Jump On Board</em> both a stirring regeneration and ecstatic confirmation of a lifetime&#39;s belief in the power of universal pop. “We feel refreshed,” smiles Sharleen. “We definitely had a <em>great</em> time making this record. It&#39;s time to jig it all up, it&#39;s like a new beginning. This is the next part of our story. And we&#39;re loving it.”<p><strong>For more information please see:</strong><p> /  / <p><p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-086752634-8,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/114/141-2.jpeg_/texas-41.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/114/141-2.jpeg_/texas-41.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/114/141-2.jpeg_/texas-41.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/114/141-2.jpeg_/texas-41.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3443,,-6.26611,2017-07-02 06:20:08,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-07 19:00:00,,Texas,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/texas-/E0-001-086752634-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,72 Dame Street,1,V0-001-000363229-8,Olympia Theatre,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/olympia-theatre-/V0-001-000363229-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Yorkston Thorne Khan have released two albums on Domino Records, with Rolling Stone calling 2017’s <strong>Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars</strong> – <em>‘</em><em>a game-changing masterpiece’</em><em>   </em><p><em><strong>Yorkston Thorne Khan</strong></em><em> began life when Suhail Yusuf Khan met James Yorkston backstage at a small festival show in Edinburgh. They got talking about music and their respective instruments and began jamming together there and then. They enjoyed it so much, they decided to take the backstage spontaneity onto the stage that very evening. Suhail and James became firm friends and after this would hook up for shows whenever Suhail was in the UK. Finally, in 2015, they recorded their debut album <strong>‘Everything Sacred’</strong>, with James bringing in his buddy Jon Thorne on double bass. “</em><em>There’s a power in a trio</em><em>” says Jon – “</em><em>You can hear yourself internally, of course, and then there’s an ear each for the other two. Perfect</em><em>”</em><p><em>Since then, YTK have gone on to play GreenMan, Field Day, Sea Change, Edinburgh International Festival, Latitude, Glastonbury and tour in India, Ireland, Spain and the UK.

Until now perhaps, for this inspired Yorkston Thorne Khan teaming operates within a similarly eclectic and free-wheeling orbit”</em><br>★★★★ <strong>The Guardian</strong> <em>“Bravely original Indian-folk-jazz fusion”</em><p>Their second<strong>, ‘Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars’</strong>, has been received equally well. Released by Domino on April 7<sup>th</sup> 2017, it represents a confluence of currents, among them the north Indian sarangi; jazz-tinged bass, reminiscent in places of Danny Thompson; acoustic guitar that owes a debt to Elizabeth Cotton, Dick Gaughan and Mississippi John Hurt; and three very different vocalists. The combination is unusual: YTK’s Everything Sacred, released in 2016, may be the only precedent. Yet while, on paper, the constituent elements might seem disparate, the new album is, if anything, even more coherent than its predecessor.<p><em> </em><p><em>★★★★★★★★</em><em> UNCUT “Not so much fusion as a cross-cultural collision”</em><p><em>★★★★★</em><em> fRoots “Brimming with confidence, ideas and musicianship, these Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars are a band of brothers at the top of their collective game”</em><p><em>★★★★★</em><em> Soundblab </em><em>“</em><em>The rivers of musical currents run deep and pure as Scottish and Indian languages, swap sounds of sorrow with universal understanding”</em><p><em>Songlines – “The fluidity of their interplay has now become almost second nature”</em><p><em>★★★★</em><em> MOJO “The sound they conjure up is Heavenly”</em><p><em>★★★★</em><em> The Guardian “Improbable trio work wonders again”</em><p>YTK Collage pic by Pulkit Sharma<p>Yorkston Thorne Khan ‘Sufi Song’ live – <a href=""https://goo.gl/t4XWh0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/t4XWh0</a><p>Yorkston Thorne Khan ‘Little Black Buzzer’ – <a href=""https://goo.gl/90swvW"" rel=""nofollow"">https://goo.gl/90swvW</a><p><a href=""http://www.yorkstonthornekhan.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.yorkstonthornekhan.com</a> / <a href=""http://www.jamesyorkston.co.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.jamesyorkston.co.uk</a><p><strong> </strong><p>Further information about James Yorkston, Jon Thorne and Suhail Yusuf Khan follows:<p><strong> </strong><p><strong>Suhail Yusuf Khan</strong><p>Suhail plays the Sarangi, an instrument he describes basically as an “<em>Indian ‘cello”</em>.

264,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2013-02-13 09:07:58," Certified Scrum Master (CSM) A Certified ScrumMaster® helps project teams properly use Scrum, increasing the likelihood of the project&#39;s overall success. CSMs understand Scrum values, practices, and applications and provide a level of knowledge and expertise above and beyond that of typical project managers. CSMs act as &quot;servant leaders,&quot; helping the rest of the Scrum team work together and learn the Scrum framework. CSMs also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. To earn your CSM certificate, you must take a CSM course from a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) or Endorsed Scrum Trainer (EST) and demonstrate your progress through our online CSM test. The first step toward your CSM is familiarizing yourself with Scrum. Then attend an in-person, two-day (16 hour) CSM course taught by a Scrum Alliance Authorized Trainer. After successfully completing the course, you will need to pass the CSM exam. To get a passing score, you must correctly answer 24 of the 35 questions.  You will be eligible for 16 Scrum Education Units (SEUs) upon completion of this course. After you pass the CSM exam, you will be asked to accept the License Agreement and complete your Scrum Alliance membership profile. This 2 day (16 hours) course fulfills the classroom requirement to become a CSM.   Who Should Take This Course   Product and Line Managers, Project Managers, Developers, Testers, Business Analysts; and anyone interested in learning more about Scrum and agile methods.    Course Outline     Below is a summary of the topics covered in this course. The learning experience covers all elements of the Content Outline and Learning Objectives identified by the Scrum Alliance, presented in an interactive and exercise-based format. This course contains a significant amount of exercises, including individual, pair, and table based activities as well as class-wide simulations.  The interactive design of the course has been refined over the years and focuses on an experience that has participants learning in a collaborative environment.    ​   Scrum Introduction The Agile Mindset Empirical Process Control The Agile Manifesto  12 Agile Principles 5 Scrum Values   ​   Scrum Roles Product Owner Development Team (aka &quot;The Team&quot;) ScrumMaster   ​   Product Backlog Items Defining PBI Product Backlog User Stories Acceptance Criteria   ​   Estimation Techniques Estimation Sequences Relative Complexity Estimating Backlog Items Velocity   ​   Sprint Events Sprint Overview Definition of Done Product Increment Release Planning Sprint Planning Sprint Backlog Daily Scrum Backlog Refinement Activity Sprint Review Sprint Retrospective   Schedule  Th – F, Time: 8:30 AM – 5:00 PM (Lunch 12:00 – 1:00 PM, Continental Breakfast 8:30am to 9am, Refreshments served throughout the day) ",City Based GeoCodes,,,,E0-001-054530768-9,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/573/438-0.jpeg_/certified-scrum-master-38.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/573/438-0.jpeg_/certified-scrum-master-38.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/573/438-0.jpeg_/certified-scrum-master-38.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/573/438-0.jpeg_/certified-scrum-master-38.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3416,,-6.25735,2017-05-22 18:36:06,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-12-14 08:30:00,,Certified Scrum Master,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/certified-scrum-master-/E0-001-054530768-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,"Stillorgan Rd. , Booterstown, Blackrock, Co.",1,V0-001-010884760-7,Radisson Blu,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/radisson-blu-/V0-001-010884760-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Students must have an up to date anti tetanus vaccine. Students must be insured by their school. Students should show interest in the charity and we appreciate students who are Junior Members and give them first priority.   To apply for a place for the Gaisce Awards please click here.     Please Note - We do not take on students doing one day a week   The DSPCA, Ireland’s oldest and largest animal rescue shelter is delighted to be able to offer work experience placements to students in Secondary Schools as part of their Transition Year or LCA. Due to our extensive programme, we can only accommodate students wishing to do at least one week’s work experience, i.e. Monday to Friday, and cannot offer placements to those wishing to carry out their An Gaisce service or to those students&#39; wishing to do one day per week over a period of time. This is due to the fact that we believe anything less than a week is of no benefit to either the student or the animals in our care. As you can imagine, places at the shelter are limited, and we advise all students who are interested to apply as soon as possible if they wish to secure a placement during the academic year. We have found that many schools choose the same weeks, thus increasing demand. Unfortunately we cannot take students suffering from animal hair allergies as the placement requires working in confined spaces with multiple dogs and cats.

WHY MEDITATE? Many of us are living busy lives and tend to often be in our heads with a constant stream of thoughts. We often forget to check in with ourselves, to be present and aware of whom we truly are.  Meditation can help you to: ~ manage stress ~ be happier ~ be healthier ~ be present ~ be more focussed ~ create inner peace ~ sleep better Structure of the Meditation Classes: Each class is run as a complete meditation practice and will include discussion of the practices, guided meditations, and contemplation. The practices used aim to create balance between body and mind. The classes are open to everyone who is interested in meditation, whether you are a complete beginner or have experience with meditation. Japanese Meditation Practices: The meditation practices used in these classes are based on the Japanese Energetic System, also called The Three Diamonds. The focus is on three energy centres, the Hara (belly), the head and the heart. In Japanese meditation practices the body-mind connection is central: the techniques used help you to get out of your head and bring your awareness back into your body. This helps focus the mind and helps you to become more grounded and present. The techniques used are characterised by simplicity. Elements we work with include utilising breath, Ki (energy) cultivation and awareness, precepts (way of being). Practical Info No need to bring anything. Just wear comfortable clothing (lockers and changing facilities are available). When you arrive, please ring the bell marked “studios”. The class is in Studio 2 on the first floor. Please arrive on time or a few minutes early so meditations will not be interrupted. The classes are led by Tessa van Keeken of Lift Your Spirit, an experienced meditation teacher. She also is a qualified Holistic Therapist, Life Coach, NLP Practitioner and Reiki Master & Teacher.

Details and booking are also on EventBrite; each event must be booked separately. FAQs I&#39;m not with a non-profit - can I attend this event? Irish Charity Lab events  are primarily for non-profits.  However, as we&#39;ve had a lot of interest from agencies and service providers, we&#39;re going to test something.  We&#39;ll make three spaces at this event available to agencies, consultants and service providers at this event, and will charge commercial rates for those tickets.  If you are with an agency or a service provider, or are a consultant, please book the correct ticket.   The best way for agencies or service providers to engage with our community is as event sponsors - you can send multiple people, and present to showcase your expertise.  if you&#39;re interested in sponsoring this or any other events, contact us on hello@irishcharitylab.org. What&#39;s the refund policy? As we are a small non-profit organisation with limited resources, we ask that if you need to cancel your booking, you give us enough time to re-sell your ticket. If you cancel an event up to a week in advance, we will fully refund your ticket. Events that are cancelled with less than five working days notice cannot be refunded; apologies for any inconvenience this causes. If you need to cancel and request a refund, you can do so through EventBrite. If you need to cancel at short notice, you can transfer your ticket to a colleague. Is it ok if the name on my ticket or registration doesn&#39;t match the person who attends? Please fill out the name(s) of the actual attendee(s) rather than the person booking the ticket. If you need to transfer your ticket to a colleague, that is no problem - you can change the name on your ticket by following these instructions. Is there a limit on the number of people that can attend from my organisation? Yes – you can send up to three people from your organisation. We restrict tickets to three per organisation to ensure that there’s a good mix of people at each event, and also so that as many organisations as possible have the opportunity to attend. If you would like to arrange training for more than three of your staff, we would be happy to talk to you about a custom training session in your office – contact hello@irishcharitylab.org.

A guitarist who has evolved the language jazz guitar in a way no other has before him, Rosenwinkel is internationally recognised as “one of the most important jazz guitarists in the game for the last quarter-century” (Ron Hart, The Observer) Kurt and Michael Buckley have collaborated on previous occasions, and thanks to mutual friend Kyle Crane, the conversation between Kurt, Michael and CEO evolved into an agreement to join forces for this special show in Dublin to perform each others music in this exciting collaboration uniting three professional musicians from Venezuela, Hungary and Peru with two jazz legends from Ireland and USA.  This is the first time that Kurt Rosenwinkel will be playing The Sugar Club and his only Irish date for 2017. “Kurt Rosenwinkel has already scaled dizzying heights as the undisputed heavyweight of modern jazz guitar, a fresh and original voice in a crowded field who has influenced practically every six-stringer to come after him.” – Cormac Larkin, The Irish Times  Rosenwinkel’s career began in the 1990s, and since then he has created 13 albums and collaborated with many diverse and extraordinary musicians, including Q-Tip, Brad Mehldau, Brian Blade, Mark Turner, Joshua Redman, Chris Potter. Known for his unique style and creative approach to playing guitar. “He sets trends among his peers with ideas about harmony and form, and he’s created an easily recognizable playing style on an instrument where individuality is rare in mainstream jazz.” (Patrick Jarenwattananon, NPR Music).  Improvisational piano trio CEO Experiment’s authentic style merges traditional Jazz with contemporary funk and fusion melodies. Together pianist Leopoldo Osio, electric bassist Peter Erdei, drummer Cote Calmet, with the recent addition of world-class saxophonist Michael Buckley, make an exceptional collective of musicians, presenting music which is modern and innovative, but also deep and vivid. Elements of Post-bop and Contemporary Jazz are channeled through original compositions and reworking of traditional standards, serving as a vehicle for high energy inter playing. “Pianist Leopoldo Osio, electric bassist Peter Erdei and drummer Cote Calmet, who make up CEO Experiment, are three of the most outstanding exponents of their respective instruments in a city whose burgeoning jazz/improvised music scene punches well above its weight.” – All About Jazz ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104424524-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/913/873-3.jpeg_/kurt-rosenwinkel-ceo-experiment-michael-buckley-73.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/913/873-3.jpeg_/kurt-rosenwinkel-ceo-experiment-michael-buckley-73.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/913/873-3.jpeg_/kurt-rosenwinkel-ceo-experiment-michael-buckley-73.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/913/873-3.jpeg_/kurt-rosenwinkel-ceo-experiment-michael-buckley-73.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-07-06 05:28:02,Europe/Dublin,evdb,"{'performer': [{'name': 'Kurt Rosenwinkel', 'creator': 'bcblackmer', 'url': 'http://concerts.eventful.com/Kurt-Rosenwinkel?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic', 'linker': 'evdb', 'short_bio': 'Jazz Guitarist', 'id': 'P0-001-000155313-7'}, {'name': 'Michael Buckley', 'creator': 'laurenmyrtle', 'url': 'http://concerts.eventful.com/Michael-Buckley?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic', 'linker': 'evdb', 'short_bio': 'Host of What The Buck?! on Youtube', 'id': 'P0-001-000128914-4'}]}",2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-30 19:30:00,,Kurt Rosenwinkel with CEO Experiment & Michael Buckley,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/kurt-rosenwinkel-ceo-experiment-michael-buckley-/E0-001-104424524-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

The band understands that for a song to be political, it needs to be more than just than a temporary rebellion: It has to dig into the essence of an identity with relentless honesty.” – Pitchfork, Best New Track<p>“… Downtown Boys are a beam of radical energy” – Rookie<p>“ …the politically-minded Rhode Island punk crew Downtown Boys slam bullying hardcore guitars, X-Ray Spex-y horns and radical lyrical fury together into a moshpit utopia.” – Rolling Stone<p>American punk band Downtown Boys have announced a date for The Workman’s Club, Dublin on October 16th.<p>Downtown Boys use their ferocious energy and powerhouse live shows to unite crowds in the struggle to smash racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people use to try to close our minds, eyes and hearts. The Providence, RI band have announced their third album, Cost of Living, to be released August 11 on Sub Pop. The new album – the follow-up to their critically-acclaimed sophomore album, 2015’s Full Communism – is at once incendiary, cathartic, and fun, melding the band’s revolutionary ideals with boundless energy. Produced by Fugazi’s Guy Picciotto, one of indie-rock’s most mythological figures (he also produced Blonde Redhead, The Gossip, and others), Cost of Living shows a sense of maturity without compromising the band’s righteous assault and captivating presence.<p>Cost of Living is Downtown Boys’ first record for storied indie label Sub Pop, and the band is using this new platform as a megaphone for their protest music, amplifying and centering Chicana, queer, and Latino voices in the far-too-whitewashed world of rock. Lyrically inspired by Assata Shakur’s poem “I believe in living,” album-opener “A Wall” rides the feel-good power that drove so many tunes by The Clash and Wire, calling out the idea that a wall could ever succeed in snuffing the humanity and spirit of those it’s designed to crush. “Promissory Note” is a bold self-introduction to the exclusive clubs that either ignore Downtown Boys’ existence, or worse, feign appreciation: “So what’s the matter, you don’t like what you see? / I can’t believe you’re even talking to me!” Ruiz shouts. “Tonta,” one of the three songs written and sung primarily in Spanish, is an introspective and emotional portrait of anguish which calls to mind the mighty scrum of Huasipungo at an ABC No Rio matinee.<p>The position of Downtown Boys has been clear since they started storming through basements and DIY spaces with their radically-minded, indefatigable rock music: they are here to topple the white-cis-het hegemony and draft a new history. This is how Downtown Boys began, and their resolve has only strengthened as both their sound and audience have grown. Like the socially conscious groups of years past, from Public Enemy to Rage Against the Machine, Downtown Boys harness powerful sloganeering, repetitive grooves, and earworm hooks to create one of the most necessary musical statements of today.<p>Downtown Boys’ new album, Cost of Living, will be released on CD / LP / CASS / DL, and is available for pre-order now.<br>LP pre-orders in North America through the Sub Pop Mega Mart and select independent retailers will receive the Loser Edition on marbled gold vinyl while supplies last. A new T-shirt design will also be available.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></strong></strong></p>",City Based GeoCodes,,,,E0-001-103355087-5,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3416,,-6.25735,2017-05-27 18:42:05,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,01295 274100,1,,D,Dublin,2017-10-16 00:00:00,,Aiken Promotions present DOWNTOWN BOYS,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-/E0-001-103355087-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,TBC,1,V0-001-002480466-9,Dublin,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-/V0-001-002480466-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

They will have an opportunity to dig for Viking treasures and artefacts dating back over 1000 years and learn about our Viking ancestors through the eyes of real archaeologists! We ensure this educational and one of a kind experience won’t leave your children disappointed.

403,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-02-02 08:53:10," Intro: The evidence shows that relationships matter – they affect our mental and physical health and well-being. When people are finding it hard to cope, particularly in their relationships, research has shown that they often turn to a frontline practitioner in their lives whom they already trust. As a frontline practitioner this can be difficult to manage when balancing a heavy caseload. However, adopting a Relational Approach and learning the skills of the brief intervention model, ABLE, strengthens frontline workers&#39; ability to support clients during these times whilst also minding themselves in the process. ABLE furnishes practitioners with the skills and steps involved in building an effective working relationship, establishing boundaries, listening actively and reflectively, and empowering service users to create solutions to their issues. A Relational Approach allows practitioners to be mindful of the relationships which form part of their service user’s and their own working lives, whilst increasing awareness of the impact of relationships on health and well-being, families and communities. Course Aim: Equip frontline practitioners with the knowledge, skills and confidence to adopt a relational approach to their practice and to use a brief intervention model, ABLE, to respond effectively to service user’s in distress.  Explore, through the course material, experiential learning exercises and group discussions, the: Brain science evidence linking relational well-being to health outcomes; Benefits of reflective functioning - making sense of what is going on for service user’s and practitioners during their practice; Application of relevant aspects of Infant Mental Health, Attachment Theory and Brain Science to help frontline practitioners better understand their service user’s and colleagues; Evidence based information on relationship stages and key messages from conflict research, with the purpose of helping service users strengthen their own relationships. How will this training help me in my work? The ABLE Training programme will: Allow you to learn the skills of a brief intervention model and have a new process for managing situations with distressed service users; Strengthen your ability to respond effectively to clients in distress using evidence based knowledge; Help you better manage your time, establish boundaries and be mindful of self-care; Enhance your understanding of the impact of relationships on health and wellbeing and your ability to apply this knowledge to practice; Increase your ability to understand what is going on for your service users and to therefore better empathise and relate to your service users; Provide a space where you can reflect on your own practice and increase the awareness of your own role in your interactions with service users. You will have an opportunity to identify areas for improvement whilst also having your capability as a practitioner refreshed, affirmed and expanded. What way will the training benefit my clients/ service users? The emphasis in this training is on early intervention and so service user’s issues are picked up upon and responded to before they escalate or become entrenched. Due to the Client and Family Centred Approach promoted in this training and brief intervention model service user’s will be listened to and empowered to come up with, and action, their own solutions. Key messages about relationships and transitions can be shared with service users thus helping them to better understand their situations and find a way forward. Service users will be provided with opportunities to share concerns and challenges they face in establishing and / maintaining healthy and supportive relationships.

433,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-03 06:55:58," <p> This is a resolutely New Orleans style from the beginnings of jazz. You&#39;ve found the hottest band to do the earliest jazz in years.<p> The New Orleans Swamp Donkeys are an extremely versatile group of young musicians who play traditional jass, blues, vaudeville, original music, modern jazz adaptations, and many other jazz and New Orleans-derived styles. They started in the authentic, New Orleans, grassroots music scene, playing local festivals and second lines, and transitioned into world-class music programs, festivals, and events, playing in concerts all over the globe. Their sound is enormously accessible with their frontman, the Louis Armstrong-sounding, soulful and sweet James Williams.<br> The Swamp Donkeys can play large and small venues, intimate crowds and boisterous audiences just the same. Formed in the fall of 2012, the band got off to an early start touring nationally in 2013. Then after selling out the Blue Note NYC in February of 2014, the Donkeys released two brand new albums &quot;Swamp Donkey&quot; (all pre-1930s covers) and &quot;Donkey Business&quot; (all original material). They closed out the first weekend of New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (JazzFest). The group then gained international internet fame when their version of the Game of Thrones theme - performed at B.B. King&#39;s in NYC - went viral, growing past a million views! They followed up this success with a European tour featuring performances at JazzAscona in Switzerland, Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain, the North Sea Jazz Festival in Netherlands, along with special appearances in France, Spain, and Monaco.<p> In 2015, they did it again, performing at Edinburgh Jazz & Blues Fest, Monte Carlo Sporting Summer Fest, and North Sea Jazz Festivals; along with Ronnie Scott&#39;s in London, The Hamilton in Washington, DC, Cliff Bell&#39;s in Detroit, and many more. Plus, the band recorded an EP with Alia Shawkat; the music video for the title song, A Fine Romance, was nominated for an Offbeat Award for Best Music Video.<p> In 2016, they&#39;ve already performed Jazz à Megève, with French Quarter Fest and JazzFest in New Orleans coming up next.<p> Featuring an all-star cast of fresh, brilliant musicians, The New Orleans Swamp Donkeys bring a remarkable, diverse appearance and sound to the stage with members current and past hailing from around the USA and the world. These are passionate jazz musicians who love the style of a hot 1910s New Orleans speakeasy, all at once resoundingly joyous and independent, soulful and rebellious. Welcome to Original Jass with the New Orleans Swamp Donkeys.</p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103512333-8,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-06-10 10:54:48,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-29 23:00:00,,New Orleans Swamp Donkeys,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-/E0-001-103512333-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

441,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-01 01:03:45," Overview In this 5 day course, you will learn about foundational skills as they pertain to network automation and programmability.  The network industry is in the midst of change, and one part of that is the operational models and technologies used to manage and operate networks on a day to day basis.  For over 20 years, the CLI has been the primary means to manage networks.  Going forward, we are starting to see more open and programmable network devices emerge – this means having device APIs not only on network switches, but also on SDN controllers in the form of northbound REST APIs.  In addition, we are also seeing network devices be integrated with existing DevOps automation tools. This course covers the skills needed to take advantage of these modern network devices.  The course is divided into two parts.  Part 1 covers raw concepts and technologies and Part 2 focuses on automating network devices.  This course includes automation of Cisco and Arista Devices.   Prerequisites While there are no programming, software/dev, or automation prerequisites, students should have a good grasp on basic networking concepts.   Course Outline Python for Network Engineers Python Interpreter Data Types Conditionals Loops Writing Python Scripts Functions Working with Files Passing Arguments from the Command Line Working with Python Modules/Packages Network (Python) APIs Parsing raw text with TextFSM Using netmiko to communicate to SSH-based devices Declarative Network Configuration with the NAPALM Python Library pyntc (multi-vendor Python library) Network Device APIs RESTful HTTP APIs Arista Command Explorer Arista eAPI Cisco NX-API Sandbox Cisco NX-API Cisco IOS-XE RESTCONF API Using Ansible for Network Automation Introduction to Ansible Writing Playbooks Inventory File Management Variable Management Network Configuration Templating Managing Network Configurations with Ansible Declarative Configuration Management Issuing Show commands with Ansible Multi-Vendor Network Automation Ansible Roles & Creating Abstractions Advanced Data Collection Create Dynamic Reports Dynamic Inventory You&#39;ll also receive bonus material for working with RESTful Network APIs, git, GitHub, and much more.

456,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-10 20:49:44," Line-up /<p><a>Fatima Yamaha</a><p> Fatima Yamaha is the story of a release on D1 Recordings, of a small number of records pressed, and of a side-product quickly put on the backburner. Yet the story picks up fully eight years later via Magnetron Music, with the electronic scene going mad for that long-forgotten song. For many years, Fatima Yamaha was shrouded in mystery, known only to be a project led by “a young lady born to a Japanese father and a Turkish mother”. Now, after two fully sold out tours in the past two years, the mystery remains. In 2015, he collaborated with Dekmantel on a reworking of his hit “What’s A Girl To Do?” and in 2017 the next hit “Araya” arrived. Meanwhile, his live shows unfailingly live up to expectations, offering refined house complemented by virtuoso synths. Fatima Yamaha is now in the spotlights of the electronic music scene, and it cannot take long until her third tour is sold out.</p></p>",City Based GeoCodes,,,,E0-001-103709755-0,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/740/718-9.jpeg_/fatima-yamaha-18.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/740/718-9.jpeg_/fatima-yamaha-18.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/740/718-9.jpeg_/fatima-yamaha-18.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/740/718-9.jpeg_/fatima-yamaha-18.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3416,,-6.25735,2017-06-10 20:49:44,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-10-21 23:00:00,,Fatima Yamaha,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/fatima-yamaha-/E0-001-103709755-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,"135-138 Francis Street, Dublin 8",1,V0-001-008391340-5,District 8,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/district-8-/V0-001-008391340-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

And although his exemplary musical output to date is deeply embedded into the framework of the world’s rock n roll DNA, it is also safe to say that his presence has been something of a glittering thorn in the side of an industry that has always had him down as a perennial outsider. Artist and painter, blues aficionado and self-confessed motoring nut, filmmaker and Italian-influenced classical music composer, <em>eclectic</em> and <em>maverick</em> are two terms that hardly come close to describing a man who has sold more than 30 million albums worldwide <em>for just being himself.</em> In 2017 Rea returns to what he’s best known for: an album of gorgeous rock ballads which showcases Rea’s unique voice and a songwriting skill at the top of his game.<p>Born in Middlesbrough in 1951, Rea released his debut album in 1978 and promptly had a huge US hit with the first track to be lifted off the record, <em>Fool If You Think It’s Over</em>. In 1983, Rea&#39;s fifth studio album <em>Water Sign</em> sold over half a million copies after <em>I Can Hear Your Heartbeat</em> became a Top 20 hit all over Europe. Rea’s follow up, <em>Wired To The Moon</em> was also a huge success and attendant tours of Europe would ensure that Rea commandeered a significant fan-base that has stayed with him through subsequent decades.<p>In 2000,Rea’s, <em>King Of The Beach</em> reached the Top 30 but his well-documented illness meant that he took a brief sabbatical from recording before returning to his blues roots.<p>Rea is not alone in the company of musicians who found fame later in life – think Jarvis Cocker, Leonard Cohen – and indeed it is interesting to note that he didn’t achieve UK Top Ten single status until the release of <em>The Road To Hell (pt2),</em> a record that was actually his eighteenth chart entry. Perhaps it is this fact that makes Rea such a breath of fresh air and a man effortlessly in control of his own faculties as a singer songwriter. <em>“I was never a rock star or pop star and all the illness has been my chance to do what I&#39;d always wanted to do with music,</em>” he says. <em>“The best change for my music has been concentrating on stuff which really interests me.“</em>  He is obviously referring to his love of motor racing, painting and the blues but if <em>Road Songs For Lovers</em> proves one thing it is this: you can add beautiful, poignant rock ‘n’ roll love songs to that pantheon of passion.<p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-069565935-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/372/095-8.jpeg_/chris-rea-95.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/372/095-8.jpeg_/chris-rea-95.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/372/095-8.jpeg_/chris-rea-95.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/372/095-8.jpeg_/chris-rea-95.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3443,,-6.26611,2017-06-16 23:38:57,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-12-06 00:00:00,,Chris Rea,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/chris-rea-/E0-001-069565935-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,72 Dame Street,1,V0-001-000363229-8,Olympia Theatre,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/olympia-theatre-/V0-001-000363229-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

502,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-07-03 05:55:14," In his recently released book, journalist Peter Moskowitz explores the unequal geography of four American cities, with their sky-high rents and high-end condos that are pushing the poorest out to the suburbs – and seeks out the stories of those who have struggled to continue to call them home. This process of gentrification is about “mass evictions, about violence, about the decimation of decades-old cultures,” he writes, in How to Kill a City: Gentrification, Inequality, and the Fight for the Neighbourhood. On Thursday 13 July, Dublin Inquirer is hosting a conversation via video-link with Moskowitz, a former staff writer with Al Jazeera America who has also written for the New York Times, New Republic, Wired and Slate. Is gentrification inevitable? Is this something we should worry about in Dublin? How do we improve cities, without making them enclaves of wealth? What role does the media play in framing discussions around changing cities?

504,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-24 01:23:25," VATeir, the Irish vACC of VATSIM, would like to invite you to its annual fly-in on Saturday the 26th of August 2017. This year’s event will take place in the Cloud Suite of the Carlton Hotel, Dublin Airport, from 10am until 5pm. What The fly-in is an opportunity to meet VATeir controllers, to understand what it is like behind the scope, and to experience what it is like in a virtual control centre for the day. Even if you can’t physically make it, VATeir’s controllers will be providing a full ATC service in Ireland throughout the day, so all VATSIM pilots will get the benefit of nationwide ATC coverage. Where The Carlton Hotel’s Cloud Suite is a conference room at the top of the hotel with a panoramic view of the final approaches to runways 28 and 34. Last year, we set up real-world ATC audio and ACARS data feeds in the room which allowed attendees to keep track of the real-life departures and arrivals while also controlling and flying on VATSIM. Transport Driving Follow this link: https://goo.gl/maps/aAuLPCDjcan From Dublin airport to the hotel The Carlton Hotel runs a free-of-charge shuttle bus from the airport to the hotel and back. The journey takes 5 minutes. Further details can be found here: http://www.carltondublinairport.com/en/airport-shuttle-bus/ From Dublin city centre to the airport The 747 bus goes from Heuston Station to the airport via the city centre and is more or less direct. The journey takes approx 20 minutes. The price is €6 one way and €10 return. https://www.dublinbus.ie/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/74711/ The 16 bus goes from Ballinteer to the airport but takes a lot longer than the 747 as it stops often. It is marginally cheaper than the 747, though. http://www.dublinbus.ie/Your-Journey1/Timetables/All-Timetables/16-2/ The Aircoach goes from the city centre to the airport T1 and T2 direct. The price is €6 one way and €10 return. Food/Drinks/Snacks Kittyhawks Bistro and Bar is open all day and serves hot and cold food. More details: http://www.carltondublinairport.com/en/dining/menus/ Who can come? The VATeir fly-in is for everyone: whether you are a controller or a pilot there will be something for you! Controllers Bring your scopes! Everyone will be given a desk with WiFi access and power connections. We will set up a virtual control centre with adjacent ATC positions sitting next to each other for verbal coordination. Pilots Bring your simulators! There is WiFi and several power outlets to enable computers to be connected to the VATSIM network. What better way to fly than to be sitting across the room from the people who are controlling you?! Members of the public/Non-VATSIM members The VATeir fly-in is for everyone: whether you are a controller or a pilot, or even if you’re just interested in aviation and would like a different perspective on the final approaches to 28 and 34, there will be something for you! How much? Members of the public are admitted completely free of charge. Attendance for VATeir members and VATSIM-registered pilots who choose to bring their flight simulators is €25. Attendees can purchase their tickets in advance at this link.   VATeir members: guaranteeing the event As the initial cost of the room is footed by the director out of their own personal money and given that last year’s event lost this person money, we kindly ask VATeir members to purchase their tickets before the 1st of August. If there is insufficient interest expressed by the membership by this date, we will have to cancel the fly-in. In this event, everyone who had paid for tickets will receive a full refund.

511,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-02-02 08:53:10," Intro: The evidence shows that relationships matter – they affect our mental and physical health and well-being. When people are finding it hard to cope, particularly in their relationships, research has shown that they often turn to a frontline practitioner in their lives whom they already trust. As a frontline practitioner this can be difficult to manage when balancing a heavy caseload. However, adopting a Relational Approach and learning the skills of the brief intervention model, ABLE, strengthens frontline workers&#39; ability to support clients during these times whilst also minding themselves in the process. ABLE furnishes practitioners with the skills and steps involved in building an effective working relationship, establishing boundaries, listening actively and reflectively, and empowering service users to create solutions to their issues. A Relational Approach allows practitioners to be mindful of the relationships which form part of their service user’s and their own working lives, whilst increasing awareness of the impact of relationships on health and well-being, families and communities. Course Aim: Equip frontline practitioners with the knowledge, skills and confidence to adopt a relational approach to their practice and to use a brief intervention model, ABLE, to respond effectively to service user’s in distress.  Explore, through the course material, experiential learning exercises and group discussions, the: Brain science evidence linking relational well-being to health outcomes; Benefits of reflective functioning - making sense of what is going on for service user’s and practitioners during their practice; Application of relevant aspects of Infant Mental Health, Attachment Theory and Brain Science to help frontline practitioners better understand their service user’s and colleagues; Evidence based information on relationship stages and key messages from conflict research, with the purpose of helping service users strengthen their own relationships. How will this training help me in my work? The ABLE Training programme will: Allow you to learn the skills of a brief intervention model and have a new process for managing situations with distressed service users; Strengthen your ability to respond effectively to clients in distress using evidence based knowledge; Help you better manage your time, establish boundaries and be mindful of self-care; Enhance your understanding of the impact of relationships on health and wellbeing and your ability to apply this knowledge to practice; Increase your ability to understand what is going on for your service users and to therefore better empathise and relate to your service users; Provide a space where you can reflect on your own practice and increase the awareness of your own role in your interactions with service users. You will have an opportunity to identify areas for improvement whilst also having your capability as a practitioner refreshed, affirmed and expanded. What way will the training benefit my clients/ service users? The emphasis in this training is on early intervention and so service user’s issues are picked up upon and responded to before they escalate or become entrenched. Due to the Client and Family Centred Approach promoted in this training and brief intervention model service user’s will be listened to and empowered to come up with, and action, their own solutions. Key messages about relationships and transitions can be shared with service users thus helping them to better understand their situations and find a way forward. Service users will be provided with opportunities to share concerns and challenges they face in establishing and / maintaining healthy and supportive relationships.

Will I have enough money to meet my desired lifestyle in retirement? If I stay for another year, or 2, or 3 years what difference will that make to my pension? Are you a D rate PRSI payer?

If you are worried about attending a Speed Friending event for the first time? Many other attendees are first-timers too and the worry only lasts about 2 minuets, that is until you realise most others are exactly the same as you i.e. nice people looking to meet other nice people. If you have any questions please contact the organiser or email us at manager@speedfriending.net or for more information on event details and policies, please see below. How the event works –The idea is that Speed Friending is an icebreaker for attendees. The first half hour will be devoted to Check-In and Mingling Games. When the Main Event begins, you will sit in a chair across from a partner. Your partner may be a woman or a man (unless you are attending a single gender event). You and your partner will have a few minutes to get to know each other, usually by talking/asking questions. When the time is up, the group will rotate and you will meet a new partner, and repeat the getting to know each other conversation. Too keep the ‘speed’ in Speed Friending we need to keep the event moving along, so you should only exchange contact information when the Main Event portion is over. There will be a short comfort break in the middle of the 90-minute Main Event. After the Main Event period, the raffle will be drawn and attendees can then exchange contact information, socialise, have food and drinks together, basically have a good memorable time hanging out. The post-event social time gives you plenty of time to ask someone for their contact details or to let them know that you will be contacting them through the speedfriending.net site. You also have the chance to naturally get to know people and catch anyone that you were not able to meet in the rotations. Good questions to ask the other attendees –Think about what you would really want to understand about someone you are trying to get to know. We recommend taking advantage of the time to ask questions like how they spend their free time, what they are seeking in a friend, what they like most about themselvs, etc. Do you need to bring any thing to the event? – Bring a pen/pencil and a paper or note with about 5 questions ready that you would want to ask your new potential friends. If you forget to prepare questions, don’t worry, we can provide supplies and suggested questions at the event. Late arrival policy – Please arrive within the first half hour of the event. If you arrive after the half hour Check-In period, we may not be able to include you in the event as late arrivals tend to disrupt rotations and distract participants. If you have pre-purchased a ticket and arrive after rotations have begun, we will not be able to credit your ticket. This rule is in place to provide the highest quality experience to those that arrive on time. Is speed friending successful? – Our average attendees finds 4 friends and 2 dates. Look at out our website to see the great things real attendees have said about their Speed Friending experience. Attendees often meet more people seeking friends in two hours at Speed Friending than they can in a year at bars/local events/online. It’s a self-selecting friendly crowd with a giant, relaxed group icebreaker activity. Will finding friends ever be easier than this? Dress code: Casual Prizes – We raffle off Meals for two, Speed Friending passes, two-person tickets to local events like comedy clubs, and other surprise items like gift cards to local venues. Finding us – We are generally in a private or partly-private room. The host will be wearing a name-badge and or be recognizable from their profile picture. If you do not see a group of people wearing name badges, ask the venue staff to direct you to the Speed Friending event. No-Show and Ticket Credit Policy – Ticket purchases are non-refundable. However, we understand that life happens. If you have purchased a ticket and will be unable to attend the event, email your organiser manager@speedfriending.net at least 24 hours prior to the event and we will issue you a credit to a future event of a similar type. If you do not notify your host at least 24 hours prior to the event and/or do not attend, you forfeit your ticket. We actively encourage prepayment as we work hard to create great events where attendees can make meaningful and lasting connections. Prepayment lowers the chance that an event gets cancelled due to low ticket sales it also reduces the chance that you will not be able to participate because an event is sold-out. Additional guidance/notes refereed to in the top section Note 1 – Arriving on time enables you to be more relaxed for the session as you will not be rushing and you get an early start lighily mingling with the others via the ice-barker games. Note 2 – Try to get the most out of the session by knowing what you want to know about the person sitting opposite you. Try not to make the questions it sound like an interview, it should feel like a natural conversation. Note 3 – Cautious persons may not want to give their full details out until they are sure that its not a bad idea. So you could communicate via speedfriending.net, meet at future events organised by speedfriending.net, have a separate handset/phone for social friends that you don’t know very well.

When the Main Event begins, you will sit in a chair across from a partner. Your partner may be a woman or a man (unless you are attending a single gender event). You and your partner will have a few minutes to get to know each other, usually by talking/asking questions. When the time is up, the group will rotate and you will meet a new partner, and repeat the getting to know each other conversation. Too keep the ‘speed’ in Speed Friending we need to keep the event moving along, so you should only exchange contact information when the Main Event portion is over. There will be a short comfort break in the middle of the 90-minute Main Event. After the Main Event period, the raffle will be drawn and attendees can then exchange contact information, socialise, have food and drinks together, basically have a good memorable time hanging out. The post-event social time gives you plenty of time to ask someone for their contact details or to let them know that you will be contacting them through the speedfriending.net site. You also have the chance to naturally get to know people and catch anyone that you were not able to meet in the rotations. Good questions to ask the other attendees –Think about what you would really want to understand about someone you are trying to get to know. We recommend taking advantage of the time to ask questions like how they spend their free time, what they are seeking in a friend, what they like most about themselvs, etc. Do you need to bring any thing to the event? – Bring a pen/pencil and a paper or note with about 5 questions ready that you would want to ask your new potential friends. If you forget to prepare questions, don’t worry, we can provide supplies and suggested questions at the event. Late arrival policy – Please arrive within the first half hour of the event. If you arrive after the half hour Check-In period, we may not be able to include you in the event as late arrivals tend to disrupt rotations and distract participants. If you have pre-purchased a ticket and arrive after rotations have begun, we will not be able to credit your ticket. This rule is in place to provide the highest quality experience to those that arrive on time. Is speed friending successful? – Our average attendees finds 4 friends and 2 dates. Look at out our website to see the great things real attendees have said about their Speed Friending experience. Attendees often meet more people seeking friends in two hours at Speed Friending than they can in a year at bars/local events/online. It’s a self-selecting friendly crowd with a giant, relaxed group icebreaker activity. Will finding friends ever be easier than this? Dress code: Casual Prizes – We raffle off Meals for two, Speed Friending passes, two-person tickets to local events like comedy clubs, and other surprise items like gift cards to local venues. Finding us – We are generally in a private or partly-private room. The host will be wearing a name-badge and or be recognizable from their profile picture. If you do not see a group of people wearing name badges, ask the venue staff to direct you to the Speed Friending event. No-Show and Ticket Credit Policy – Ticket purchases are non-refundable. However, we understand that life happens. If you have purchased a ticket and will be unable to attend the event, email your organiser manager@speedfriending.net at least 24 hours prior to the event and we will issue you a credit to a future event of a similar type. If you do not notify your host at least 24 hours prior to the event and/or do not attend, you forfeit your ticket. We actively encourage prepayment as we work hard to create great events where attendees can make meaningful and lasting connections. Prepayment lowers the chance that an event gets cancelled due to low ticket sales it also reduces the chance that you will not be able to participate because an event is sold-out. Additional guidance/notes refereed to in the top section Note 1 – Arriving on time enables you to be more relaxed for the session as you will not be rushing and you get an early start lighily mingling with the others via the ice-barker games. Note 2 – Try to get the most out of the session by knowing what you want to know about the person sitting opposite you. Try not to make the questions it sound like an interview, it should feel like a natural conversation. Note 3 – Cautious persons may not want to give their full details out until they are sure that its not a bad idea. So you could communicate via speedfriending.net, meet at future events organised by speedfriending.net, have a separate handset/phone for social friends that you don’t know very well.

Integral Sound Healing deals effectively with these underlying causes of pain, dis-ease and illness. This has been documented in thousands of written case studies carried out by the teachers, practitioners and students of our Sound Healing Academy. KEY FEATURES OF THIS COURSE: UNIQUE 10-STEP HEALING PROCESS This course is structured around our unique 10-Step Healing process with sounds which transforms an ordinary sound healing session into one that is extra-ordinarily effective and transformative.   The 10-Steps are: Client Connection; Intention Setting; Assessing Energy Field Dynamics; Co-creating Resonance; Triggering Relaxation; Releasing; Transforming Resistance; Reforming; Reflecting and Recommending.   CLIENT DYNAMICS The quality of the relationship between you and your clients is critical to the success of the healing process.   We cover the most significant dynamics in this relationship: building rapport; active listening, client engagement & managing energy flows.   MUSIC MEDICINE Although the instruments we use to create the healing sounds are easy to play, we teach key musical concepts and techniques that enhance the healing process, including: natural harmonics and overtones; musical intervals; dynamics of consonance, dissonance, rhythm, amplitude & sensitivity.   ASSESSING ENERGY FIELDS To be effective in facilitating positive healing outcomes for your clients you need to make accurate assessments of the state of your clients’ energy fields – both physical and subtle.   You’ll learn reliable techniques for making these assessments using both sound and muscle testing, based on classic kinesiology.   BALANCING THE BIOFIELD We teach you how you can work with therapeutic instruments and your voice to correct distortions in the energy fields of your clients, including the biofield (aura), chakras and meridians to achieve harmony, balance and healing.   You’ll learn effective techniques for working both off and on the body of your clients.   INTEGRAL SOUND HEALING Healing is most profound and long-lasting when we adopt integral perspectives and practices.   We draw on the Integral Medicine models of Amit Goswami, Ken Wilber, Marylin Schlitz and others.   We work with sounds to facilitate healing in all 5 dimensions of consciousness: physical; emotional; mental; soul and spirit. Mindful awareness of outer and inner sounds creates a state of deep relaxation and peace.   We also create the safe conditions for the release, integration and transformation of deeply suppressed, repressed and oppressed emotions that underlie most physical and mental health challenges facing our clients. Course Fee: 6-day Workshop + Online Learning Centre + Coaching & Mentoring +Webinar Recordings + Live Webinars + Assessment & Certificate: 1650€      The course fee does not include accommodation or meals.  We are happy to provide details of local places to stay and eat.

547,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-07-06 05:29:37," The Event Theme – Lean Processing Systematically Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy that pursues the continuous elimination of waste in all business processes though kaizen, also known as small and incremental improvement. Many of us are familiar with this common definition of Lean. While it is certainly accurate, we often find that the specific benefits that Lean will have on individual processes, and eventually entire companies, are seldom discussed. While it makes sense that the elimination of waste will result in more efficient operations, this event will explore what is achieved after much waste has been eliminated from a shop floor and production process, mainly through single/one piece flow. FIND OUT MORE AT http://eeireland.com In Ireland, nearly 200,000 people are working in the manufacturing sector. As a process-rich environment, manufacturing and production environments are ideal for implementing Lean and Six Sigma principles. Benefits include Enhanced productivity Improved efficiency Streamlined processes and Increased competitiveness Business improvements in Lean Manufacturing are enabled using Lean approaches, including: TPM/OEE, 6S & Workplace Organisation and PIT Meetings. Lean best practice is to first, identify waste; then, eliminate it and to identify areas of waste in manufacturing within Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over-processing, Defects and Skills. Eliminating these areas of waste is crucial for the success of any Lean programme.     ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104424578-4,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/913/906-0.jpeg_/enterprise-excellence-ireland-2018-06.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/913/906-0.jpeg_/enterprise-excellence-ireland-2018-06.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/913/906-0.jpeg_/enterprise-excellence-ireland-2018-06.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/913/906-0.jpeg_/enterprise-excellence-ireland-2018-06.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.36072388693222,,-6.251096423001059,2017-07-06 05:29:37,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,Dublin 3,1,,D,Dublin,2018-05-29 08:30:00,,Enterprise Excellence Ireland 2018,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/enterprise-excellence-ireland-2018-/E0-001-104424578-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Jones' Road,1,V0-001-000694867-7,Croke Park,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/croke-park-/V0-001-000694867-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Barry works with business leaders and teams from global organizations that seek to invent the future, not fear it. Every day, Barry works with many of the world’s leading companies to break the vicious cycles that spiral businesses toward death by enabling experimentation and learning to unlock the insights required for better decision making and higher performance and results. Barry is co-author of the international bestseller Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale—included in the Eric Ries Lean series, and a Harvard Business Review must read for CEOs and business leaders. He is an internationally sought-after speaker, frequent writer and contributor to The Economist, Strategy+Business,and MIT Sloan Management Review.

His mission is to help purposeful technology-led businesses innovate at scale. TESTIMONIALS “Barry was instrumental in the conception and formation of an &#39;innovation engine&#39; at lastminute.com. Not only were we able to identify and develop winning ideas at pace but the whole organization was reinvigorated by an approach which delivered measurable results, doubling revenue for the business.” John Crosby former Chief Product, Trading and Commercial Officer at lastminute.com and Travelocity International “The Google Sprint Master Academy invited Barry to speak to our trainees on coaching and collaborating with senior stakeholders to create space for continuous innovation in the product development lifecycle. He shared advice on leadership, business transformation and inspired our Sprint Masters to push innovation throughout the company” Kai Haley, Lead of Design Relations and Sprint Master Academy, Google “Barry’s approach of driving very early customer testing well ahead of when it would normally be done - in parallel with developing the bigger vision - forces a focus on minimum viable product and early proof points. This proved to be very engaging in our business for stakeholders up to board level. Instead of &#39;here is a big programme - trust us&#39; the message was &#39;here is a game changing initiative and you can touch and feel the first steps of it’. Barry brings a very practical style and methodology to bear which empowered the team - so we really owned the outcome and developed both as a team and as individuals.” John Mornement General Manager at Major International Co. “Barry helped AIB, the largest retail bank in Ireland, achieve a step change in its digital journey. By combining his senior level communication skills with his deep insight on how to leverage technology at scale, he influenced key stakeholders across the bank to do things differently.” Allan Molloy former Head of Customers, Channels and Payments, Allied Irish Bank “Barry has a really synthetic view, which is key to reducing challenges to small iterations that help in getting quick feedback and re-adapting to maximize value. He really understands lean and agile methodologies and sees how they can be used, not only in startups, but even in larger, more complex companies.” Samuel Lacarta Chavarrias Commercial Director, Vueling Airlines “Agility in a digital world is no longer optional and if you don’t embrace experimentation and value based decision making in your market, then someone else will. Barry can take you and your team on a journey towards disrupting the disruptors and then, like us, you will learn to use techniques such as Lean Product Development and Workload Visualisation in order to make the right &quot;customer-based&quot; decisions. These techniques also made us address every aspect of our thinking from just in time architecture towards continuous delivery, hence cutting cycle times in half in order to deliver new products and platforms more frequently. In fact we went from huge twice yearly releases to multiple releases per day. This way of working not only energizes the team but it enables innovation through learning and more importantly builds mutual respect between stakeholders which may be broken.” Fin Goulding, former CIO at PaddyPower BetFair &quot;Barry is exceptionally good at leading teams in the process of new product development. He gets the team to use the lean toolkit to build and test in fast iterations, getting results that may not be achievable in other ways. Barry led a team in delivering  two product development projects at JustGiving and helped us test our ideas very quickly and effectively. He is an excellent coach to the team, leaving everyone energized and more productive after each interaction.&quot;    Anna Kuriakose, former Chief Product Officer at JustGiving “Barry constantly challenged what others held to be sacred in order to deliver a series of rapid proofs of totally new concepts for JustGiving, and together we explored the complex boundary between business fundamentals and software development to forge experimental new practices.” Richard Atkinson, former CIO at JustGiving &quot;I don&#39;t often come away from a workshop with pages of notes that I actually read. This was definitely an exception. What Barry O&#39;Reilly has to say about how organisations can manage their work is invaluable for any business leader.  The &quot;Lean Enterprise&quot; book is packed full of wisdom and Barry&#39;s session captured some of the most important parts in an engaging and entertaining way.&quot; Andy Kelk, CTO, Marketplacer WHAT ELSE?

From the bestselling, twice Orange Prize-shortlisted, National Book Award-nominated author comes a vibrant tale of transformation: of a man in his later years and a woman novelist, each drawn to the Levant on a journey of self-discovery. Bursting with life and humour, Forest Dark is a profound, mesmerising, achingly beautiful novel of metamorphosis and self-realisation – of looking beyond all that is visible towards the infinite.

Presented in collaboration with Science Gallery Dublin, the festival will include a selection of new and classic films, including a free screening of Roy Cohen’s documentary Machine of Human Dreams. With the financial backing of the Hong Kong government, Ben Goertzel believes he finally will realise his lifelong dream of developing human-like artificial intelligence using software that mimics the complex operation of the human mind. Assembling a ragtag team of experts to assist him, the eccentric researcher sets out to create functioning, reasoning humanoid robots. But as pressure mounts to deliver results to his investors, stories about his past enterprises expose the human consequences – and potential limits – of his ambitions.

590,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-05-17 20:26:13," Affect Regulation Theory: Clinical Applications A 2-day interactive training workshop with Dr Allan N. Schore Dublin, 25 & 26 September 2017, Monday & Tuesday O&#39;Callaghan Davenport Hotel, 8-10 Merrion Street Lower, Dublin 2, Ireland At this interactive training workshop over 2 days, Dr Schore describes his ongoing work on Affect Regulation Theory, an evidence-based interpersonal neurobiological model of development, psychopathogenesis, and treatment of the early forming emotional core of the right brain subjective self. Of particular relevance to psychotherapists, counsellors, psychologists and psychiatrists, the workshop uses a series of PowerPoint lectures, audience dialogues and examples of early Attachment Trauma; together with essential themes from Dr Schore’s latest book, The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy to elucidate how, as therapists, we can: focus on our own right brain functions so we can effectively process and regulate our client’s unconsciously communicated bodily-based affective states gain a deeper comprehension of regulated enactments and allow these to inform our therapeutic approaches interpret recent neurobiological data – that allows us to enhance our therapeutic creativity and understand data from neuroscience, developmental psychology, pediatrics, endocrinology, and psychiatry that explains gender differences in brain and developmental psychopathology Overall, the workshop focusses on the pragmatic clinical applications of Affect Regulation Theory, with specific attention to the psychoneurobiological change mechanisms embedded in the psychotherapy relationship. About the speaker Dr. Allan Schore is on the clinical faculty of the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine. He is author of four seminal volumes, Affect Regulation and the Origin of the Self, Affect Dysregulation and Disorders of the Self, Affect Regulation and the Repair of the Self, and most recently The Science of the Art of Psychotherapy, as well as numerous articles and chapters. His contributions appear in multiple disciplines, including developmental neuroscience, psychiatry, psychoanalysis, developmental psychology, infant mental health, attachment theory, trauma studies, behavioral biology, clinical psychology, and clinical social work.  Dr. Schore is a reviewer or on the editorial staff of over 45 journals.  He has received a number of honors for his work, including an Award for Outstanding Contributions to Practice in Trauma Psychology from the Division of Trauma Psychology and the Scientific Award from the Division of Psychoanalysis of the American Psychological Association, Honorary Membership by the American Psychoanalytic Association for “extraordinary contributions to the field of psychoanalysis,” and the Reiss-Davis Child Study Center Award for outstanding contributions to Child and Adolescent Mental Health.  He has had a private psychotherapy practice for four decades. Programme Day 1, Monday, 25 September 2017 9:00AM: Registration 9:30AM: Module 1: A Regulation Model of Clinical Expertise for Working with Early Relational Trauma In this opening PowerPoint lecture Dr. Schore will overview his current clinical, research, and theoretical studies in developmental affective neuroscience, traumatology, and neuropsychoanalysis, in order to discuss the relational and neurobiological underpinnings of clinical expertise in the treatment of clients with histories of early attachment trauma. He will offer interdisciplinary evidence which indicates that our conception of the expert clinician has changed, from one who offers insight-oriented interpretations in order to make the unconscious conscious to one who optimally processes and regulates the client’s unconsciously communicated bodily-based affective states in order to facilitate development of the unconscious mind and thereby a coherent and integrated subjective sense of self.  These clinical skills involve the therapist’s right brain functions for receiving, processing, and regulating the client’s bodily-based affective states.   1:00PM: Lunch Break (a light lunch is provided as part of the workshop) 2:00PM: Module 2: A Paradigm Shift in the Therapeutic Approach to Clinical Enactments The ongoing paradigm shift in the psychological and biological sciences is deepening our understanding of the affective and neurobiological dynamics of clinical enactments of early attachment trauma. Very recent relational and neuropsychoanalytic models posit that enactments are inevitable eruptions of unconsciously strong overwhelming affect within the therapeutic relationship and not technical mistakes, and that they represent an important relational context for therapeutically reaching deeply into traumatized areas of the brain/mind/body. The shift from cognition to emotion, from conscious to unconscious processes, and from left to right brain allows for a deeper understanding of how regulated enactments are a central mechanism of therapeutic action, especially for clients with a history of relational trauma.  5:00PM: Close Day 2, Tuesday, 26 September 2017 9:00AM: Registration 9:30AM: Module 3: The Right Brain in Therapeutic Creativity Within psychology and psychiatry there is a long history studying creativity in people with outstanding achievements as well as in those with mental disorders.  More recent models view creativity as a personality trait in all individuals. In parallel, a body of research within neuroscience highlights the essential role of the right hemisphere in creativity. In this lecture Dr. Schore will cite both the neuroscience and clinical literatures to offer a neurobiological model of interpersonal creativity in the psychotherapeutic context, in both client and therapist.  As examples, he will describe the critical role of the clinician’s creativity when working with right brain affects, especially in joint enactments, in processing novel intrapersonal and interpersonal information within therapeutic moments of spontaneous play, in facilitating the client’s expanding tolerance for interpersonal novelty and psychotherapeutic change, and in the development of therapeutic expertise.  He will also present recent neurobiological data which suggests that an optimal therapeutic experience can expand both the client’s and the therapist’s right brain implicit creative functions. 1:00PM: Lunch Break (a light lunch is provided as part of the workshop) 2:00PM: Module 4: The Developmental Neurobiology of Boys at Risk: Gender Differences in Brain and Developmental Psychopathology The alarming increased risk of boys for educational, behavioral, and mental health problems is well documented, and yet few studies have been done on the early social and emotional neurobiological development of these deficits.  A large body of studies indicate that males are more at risk than females for autism, schizophrenia, ADHD, and conduct disorders, and that these same disorders are now significantly increasing.  Dr. Schore will discuss this problem through the lens of neurobiologically informed modern attachment theory and current research on gender differences in early brain development.  He will cite studies from neuroscience, developmental psychology, pediatrics, endocrinology, and psychiatry which suggests that the male fetal and neonatal brain develops at a slower rate than females, and that this longer period of immaturity leads to an increased risk for both early relational trauma and for exposure to endocrine disruptors, environmental toxins that alter the developmental trajectory of the male’s early maturing right brain. He will also discuss the relevance of interpersonal neurobiology for early assessment and interventions with infant and toddler boys. 5:00PM: Close   © nscience 2016 / 17   ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103071350-7,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/537/661-8.png_/affect-regulation-theory-clinical-applications-61.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/537/661-8.png_/affect-regulation-theory-clinical-applications-61.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/537/661-8.png_/affect-regulation-theory-clinical-applications-61.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/537/661-8.png_/affect-regulation-theory-clinical-applications-61.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3408283,,-6.2497627,2017-07-05 04:09:24,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-25 09:30:00,,Affect Regulation Theory: Clinical Applications,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/affect-regulation-theory-clinical-applications-/E0-001-103071350-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,"Merrion Square, Dublin 2",1,V0-001-002179631-4,O CALLAGHAN DAVENPORT HOTEL,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/o-callaghan-davenport-hotel-/V0-001-002179631-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

The band understands that for a song to be political, it needs to be more than just than a temporary rebellion: It has to dig into the essence of an identity with relentless honesty.” – Pitchfork, Best New Track<p>“… Downtown Boys are a beam of radical energy” – Rookie<p>“ …the politically-minded Rhode Island punk crew Downtown Boys slam bullying hardcore guitars, X-Ray Spex-y horns and radical lyrical fury together into a moshpit utopia.” – Rolling Stone<p>American punk band Downtown Boys have announced a date for The Workman’s Club, Dublin on October 16th.<p>Downtown Boys use their ferocious energy and powerhouse live shows to unite crowds in the struggle to smash racism, queerphobia, capitalism, fascism, boredom, and all things people use to try to close our minds, eyes and hearts. The Providence, RI band have announced their third album, Cost of Living, to be released August 11 on Sub Pop. The new album – the follow-up to their critically-acclaimed sophomore album, 2015’s Full Communism – is at once incendiary, cathartic, and fun, melding the band’s revolutionary ideals with boundless energy. Produced by Fugazi’s Guy Picciotto, one of indie-rock’s most mythological figures (he also produced Blonde Redhead, The Gossip, and others), Cost of Living shows a sense of maturity without compromising the band’s righteous assault and captivating presence.<p>Cost of Living is Downtown Boys’ first record for storied indie label Sub Pop, and the band is using this new platform as a megaphone for their protest music, amplifying and centering Chicana, queer, and Latino voices in the far-too-whitewashed world of rock. Lyrically inspired by Assata Shakur’s poem “I believe in living,” album-opener “A Wall” rides the feel-good power that drove so many tunes by The Clash and Wire, calling out the idea that a wall could ever succeed in snuffing the humanity and spirit of those it’s designed to crush. “Promissory Note” is a bold self-introduction to the exclusive clubs that either ignore Downtown Boys’ existence, or worse, feign appreciation: “So what’s the matter, you don’t like what you see? / I can’t believe you’re even talking to me!” Ruiz shouts. “Tonta,” one of the three songs written and sung primarily in Spanish, is an introspective and emotional portrait of anguish which calls to mind the mighty scrum of Huasipungo at an ABC No Rio matinee.<p>The position of Downtown Boys has been clear since they started storming through basements and DIY spaces with their radically-minded, indefatigable rock music: they are here to topple the white-cis-het hegemony and draft a new history. This is how Downtown Boys began, and their resolve has only strengthened as both their sound and audience have grown. Like the socially conscious groups of years past, from Public Enemy to Rage Against the Machine, Downtown Boys harness powerful sloganeering, repetitive grooves, and earworm hooks to create one of the most necessary musical statements of today.<p>Downtown Boys’ new album, Cost of Living, will be released on CD / LP / CASS / DL, and is available for pre-order now.<br>LP pre-orders in North America through the Sub Pop Mega Mart and select independent retailers will receive the Loser Edition on marbled gold vinyl while supplies last. A new T-shirt design will also be available.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></strong></strong></p>",City Based GeoCodes,,,,E0-001-103355087-5,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/608/414-9.jpeg_/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-14.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3416,,-6.25735,2017-05-27 18:42:05,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,01295 274100,1,,D,Dublin,2017-10-16 00:00:00,,Aiken Promotions present DOWNTOWN BOYS,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/aiken-promotions-present-downtown-boys-/E0-001-103355087-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,TBC,1,V0-001-002480466-9,Dublin,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-/V0-001-002480466-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Now they come together once again, with a worldwide touring schedule and a new studio album coming in 2017. Their new project, as always, is a page from the big book of North Americana and outsider folk.<p>Holland grew up in Texas, and by her teens was performing as a traveling musician. In the late ’90s, she called San Francisco home before making her way to Canada where she co-founded the Tanyas with Vancouver singer-songwriter Samantha Parton. Parton had spent her post-high school years traveling with her guitar, and drawing strong musical inspiration from visits to the southern US; she spent time living in New Orleans, Holland’s ancestral home.<p><p>After contributing to the Tanyas’ acclaimed Blue Horse LP, Holland moved back to San Francisco while Parton continued to tour and record with the group until a serious car accident took her off the road in 2012. With this new creative incarnation, expect to hear newly written originals, fresh arrangements of The Be Good Tanyas material, and songs from their individual catalogues.<p>Tickets priced €18 go on sale Thursday 9th March now through <a href=""http://www.ticketmaster.ie/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.ticketmaster.ie</a> & usual outlets nationwide.<br><strong>TICKETS</strong><br><br><p>ON SALE THUR 9th MAR, 9AM: €18 available online from <a href=""http://www.whelanslive.com/index.php/wav-tickets"" rel=""nofollow"">WAV Tickets</a> or Lo-Call <a rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"">1890 200 078</a> (1-8pm M-F, 4-8pm Sat)<p>– 50c per ticket service charge applies on phone, internet or creditcard bookings.

635,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-07-06 05:29:37," The Event Theme – Lean Processing Systematically Lean manufacturing is a management philosophy that pursues the continuous elimination of waste in all business processes though kaizen, also known as small and incremental improvement. Many of us are familiar with this common definition of Lean. While it is certainly accurate, we often find that the specific benefits that Lean will have on individual processes, and eventually entire companies, are seldom discussed. While it makes sense that the elimination of waste will result in more efficient operations, this event will explore what is achieved after much waste has been eliminated from a shop floor and production process, mainly through single/one piece flow. FIND OUT MORE AT http://eeireland.com In Ireland, nearly 200,000 people are working in the manufacturing sector. As a process-rich environment, manufacturing and production environments are ideal for implementing Lean and Six Sigma principles. Benefits include Enhanced productivity Improved efficiency Streamlined processes and Increased competitiveness Business improvements in Lean Manufacturing are enabled using Lean approaches, including: TPM/OEE, 6S & Workplace Organisation and PIT Meetings. Lean best practice is to first, identify waste; then, eliminate it and to identify areas of waste in manufacturing within Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Over-processing, Defects and Skills.

They were both regulars on the infamous Chicago high school party scene, where packed school halls were filled with the sounds of local DJs such as the Hot Mix Five. From the school on to the club, they frequented Ron Hardy’s Muzic Box and started producing music themselves. At some point a friend recommended they visit Larry Sherman, co-owner of Trax Records, and from then on it took a few visits and a discerning dog, but they eventually released their first – and seminal – single Do You Know Who You Are? on Trax in 1989. Under Virgo Four and their aliases M.E. and Ace & Sandman the pair released more music over the next few years, but after a while took up other professions.<p> Over 20 years later Amsterdam’s Rush Hour crew released the seminal re-issue compilation Resurrection, unearthing no less than 30 original Virgo Four tracks, getting the pair the attention they deserve. Virgo Four&#39;s cuts on Rush Hour reconquered the house heads in the exact same way, notably with the Caribou remix of their It&#39;s A Crime track. Now, Eric and new recruit Terry Ivy are continuing the legacy without missing a step.<p><strong>New Jackson</strong><p> Dublin based producer New Jackson’s forthcoming LP for All City, From Night to Night is exactly the kind of house we’re besotted with here at THUMP.

John F Ryan, Director, at the European Commission Health and Food Safety Directorate General Directorate C – Public Health and Crisis Management will give a keynote address on European priorities in the environment and health nexus.  We will also hear from Dr Simon O’Rafferty on a product design led approach to successful public engagement, and Dr Easkey Britton who is a researcher at the NUIG Whitaker Inst. Working on Social Innovation, Participation and Policy.  The conference will also include a series of presentations from practice based experience in engaging with citizen led science and communities followed by a panel and audience led discussion on addressing benefits, challenges and needs for such engagement. This Conference is a free event aimed at HSE and EPA staff working in the Health, Wellbeing and citizen engagement area, as well as for NGOs and Academics. Successfully engaging citizens and communities is enormously challenging, yet without such engagement, the essential transition to sustainable and healthy living is impossible.  This year’s conference follows on from a successful event in 2016, the presentations from which are available to view and download at:    http://www.epa-pictaural.com/nav/sHse16.php ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104256279-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3406799,,-6.2684350,2017-06-30 08:12:00,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-11-29 09:00:00,,HSE-EPA ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH CONFERENCE 2017,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-/E0-001-104256279-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Golden Lane Dublin 8,1,V0-001-000622006-7,Radisson SAS Royal Hotel Dublin,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/radisson-sas-royal-hotel-dublin-/V0-001-000622006-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

The course will take place over 3 days (2 full days and 1 evening) The purpose of the new Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Charter and Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education are intended to support and guide all those working in the early childhood care and education sector to explore, understand and develop inclusive practices for the benefit of all children and their families. Topics included in the Equality and Diversity training: Terminology Stages of discrimination Anti- bias goals Legislation Reviewing the Early Years environment Challenging discrimination About Access and Inclusion Model (AIM) The purpose of the new Inclusion Charter is to demonstrate the sector’s commitment to inclusion. Service providers are asked to sign-up to the Charter by completing an inclusion policy for their setting. For reference purposes, an Inclusion Policy template is contained within the Guidelines.

724,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-05-06 03:58:59," Hosted by Ivan Lentijo Fernandez, who is a U.K. Hypnosis Academy Trainer, Kinetic Shift Practitioner and a Hypnotherapist since 2011.Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic, EnergisingKinetic Shift …What is It? And what will it do for you?Kinetic Shift is a rapid method combining several different techniques to resolve Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, Weight Loss, Smoking and even PTSD and much more. We all know that we can’t express everything we want to verbally, so we use several other methods of communication and that is key to Kinetic Shift.Who can use it? Everyone from Beginners to Seasoned therapists….. it&#39;s so simple and fun you can do it anywhere.Sub-modalities, Confusion, Metaphors, Shamanistic, Intuition and Theatrical are what make up Kinetic Shift a complete opposite to the classically trained methods you see….. Clients love it and so do the practitioners. &quot;I attended the 2 day Kinetic Shift course and the only words I can use to describre this are Amazing, Fantastic and Life Changing . Fabolous weekend, learning so much, building confidence and meeting so many interesting like minded people&quot; Susan Watson &quot;I first attender this course a year ago and all of a sudden it made hypnosis and my therapy business feel &quot;fresh&quot; again Key is the level of particiption, the energy is high and everyone leaves confident to apply the techniques immediately. I recommend this 100%&quot; Matt Gilbert   Kinetic Shift was developed by Karl Smith after years and years of watching and participating in boring and really pathetic hypnotherapy methods, laying the client down and really boring them to death with long-winded scripts or monotone voices. After 2 years of field testing with Military and Emergency Services personnel, he finalised the 7 simplistic stages of Kinetic Shift.  Watch this video of Karl Smith (Founder of UK Hypnosis Academy) and Ivan L. Fernandez (UK Hypnosis Academy Trainer) Hypnotherapy Scripts are great but they should be thrown out at the earliest point in a hypnotherapists career, as they offer little except words and pacing. Which is great, but then you have to develop, and that&#39;s where Kinetic Shift fits in……by Developing Confidence and Speed in a therapist work, also working intuitively with your clients…. making them feel special.Now, what will this technique do? Compared to the Classical lay down and keep quiet Hypnotherapy, It will get the client to participate. Remember Hypnosis is not a state of eyelids…. their eyes can be open, so most of the work in Kinetic Shift is eyes open.Kinetic Shift gets the intuitive part of the therapist into overdrive watching every move, every twitch, every eye movement and emotion the client displays during your session and ensures that by the time they leave you, you the therapist, they will know there life is changed…..its fun!Use the Clients feelings and emotions, use their State ……Work directly with the MIND, Not the Cognitive part of the brain that will lie or cover up.No more….. “I went to a therapist and I laid there and It didn’t work!” With Kinetic Shift, they will know something happened.Kinetic Shift is broken down into 7 stages and will bring your therapy sessions to life, that is a fact! Your clients will love it….WHY? It&#39;s fun and they can feel Kinetic Shift as is happens.With 100’s of people trained in 7 countries (to date) and not one therapist has said, &quot;I can’t use it.&quot; It will bring your sessions to life and WILL bring you more clients…. because the last thing your client will remember is an extraordinary experience and amazing sensation.Kinetic Shift will do 2 things…..Give YOUR client a fun and life-changing session, and also change the way you work and feel in a session, it brings out the passion you have in a therapy room!Describing Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic and Energising. I guarantee you will change the way you work, you will practice, practice, practice and you will have immense fun on this course. &quot;Brilliant. Love it. Would recommend to any therapists. Had so much fun and met some amazing people. I learned so much. Worth every penny. Thank you.&quot; Lorna Cracknell   &quot;If you are in the business of helping people, then you are missing a powerful tool if Kinetic Shift is not yet in your arsenal. The 2 days spent with Karl and his team drive your confidence through the roof as you learn change happens fast and easy. The techniques at not so much taught, but rather installed so that they are second nature by the end.  Make sure you are one of the ones making a rel difference by using Kinetic Shift&quot; Barry Collins This is a two-day course running from 9:30 to 17:30 on day one, and from 9:30 to 17:00 on day two.Certification requires attendance on both days.BOOK YOUR SEAT NOW ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102713097-1,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3430419,,-6.2637154,2017-06-29 04:53:15,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-08-26 09:30:00,,Hypnosis Foundation (Rapid inductions) & Kinetic Shift Technique,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-sh-/E0-001-102713097-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Exchequer Street Dublin 2&nbsp,1,V0-001-001859381-4,The Central Hotel,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-central-hotel-/V0-001-001859381-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

At the end of the workshop the student will have a working Fuzz guitar pedal they can take home with them. After a safety talk, we begin the workshop by providing a comprehensive soldering lesson, where users will learn the correct and safe way to solder. We include how to solder to a circuit board as well as connecting wires together. Following this we begin the build, starting at the stomp switch, followed by the circuit board and other connections. Once everything is soldered together we place everything into a solid aluminium enclosure. As we go through the build we explain what each part of the circuit is for and how it affects the sound. We also introduce the students to the circuit’s schematic and explain how it all works together. No experience required but this workshop is strictly 15+.

The project was hailed as one of the year’s finest hip-hop debuts, with press noting Logic’s superior lyricism, cinematic storytelling and important message of peace, love and positivity. The Huffington Post crowned Under Pressure“ 2014&#39;s Best Hip-Hop Album So Far,” iTunes named it “Best Hip Hop Album 2014,” Artist Direct called it “The Best Debut of 2014,” and MTV News nominated it as “Rap Album Of The Year Contender.” The buzz earned Logic performances on The Tonight Show starring Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lollapalooza, Wireless Festival UK, Governor’s Ball, and a headline world tour.<p>Logic’s sophomore effort was the 18-track long-player The Incredible True Story (November 2015), which crafted a sci-fi space odyssey script that developed throughout the interludes on the album, and cemented Logic’s status as one of music&#39;s most creative young MCs. After the album debuted at #1 on the USR&B/Hip Hop Chart, he embarked on the 2016 Incredible World Tour across the U.S. and Canada from February through April. “Bobby Tarantino,” his summer 2016 mixtape, upped the ante, as Billboard declared “Logic heats up the summer with a new banger,” as Logic co-headlined a massive summer amphitheatre and arena tour.<p>In 2017, Logic continues to raise the bar with the release of his third full-length album Everybody. The album touches on societal issues that affect us all on a daily basis, including anxiety, depression, race relations and more. Everybody features a wide-array of artists and personalities including Neil de Grasse Tyson, Killer Mike, Chuck D, Alessia Cara and Khalid and has become his most commercially successful album to date.<p><p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104318816-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/844/695-4.jpeg_/logic-95.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/844/695-4.jpeg_/logic-95.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/844/695-4.jpeg_/logic-95.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/844/695-4.jpeg_/logic-95.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3443,,-6.26611,2017-07-02 12:54:58,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-11-05 19:00:00,,Logic,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/logic-/E0-001-104318816-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,72 Dame Street,1,V0-001-000363229-8,Olympia Theatre,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/olympia-theatre-/V0-001-000363229-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

PRESENTER:  Kevin Baskerville, Leicestershire Autism Outreach Service Manager, Lead for East Midlands Hub for AET (Autism Education Trust)AsFAN is delighted to have Kevin deliver this important workshop.Kevin is the Leicestershire Autism Outreach Service (AOS) Manager and developed a program AOS (Intensive Support) in order to work with students who find accessing mainstream education a significant challenge.  He likes to use a variety of multimedia approaches (so that you’re not just listening to someone speak!!!) and has a role-play free-zone!!! Kevin incorporates information from young people with ASD to help shape and inform practice.As the pressures increase on our children, more and more children with ASD become school refusers.  In this interactive workshop, we look at the reasons why children may refuse to attend school, we explore ways to keep our children within school but then strategies and approaches to use to ease them back.Discussions will take place around ways to use Special Interests, developing Neuro-harmony amongst students (and staff), developing Child Centered Planning systems to help children look at possibilities but also looking at what the community, the family and the educational establishment needs to do to build confidence for all.At the end of this workshop participants will have seen: approaches that are having positive impacts elsewhere and therefore had been involved in discussions on how to make this work locally a variety of strategies and resources used to build trust, confidence in young people with ASD important tools to measure practice, progression and competency in order for establishments to be able to see where they are and what they need to do.

Cybercrime has changed the world of enterprise security and how networks and organisations are attacked. As cyber threats increase in sophistication targeting both people and companies, organisations must evolve to remain one step ahead of the threats.  These threats, and the cyber-criminals behind them, are experts at remaining hidden from traditional security while exhibiting an intelligence, resiliency and patience never been seen before. Leading industry experts will focus on key areas including: Taking Control of your Cyber Security Protecting and Defending Against Cyber Threats in Uncertain Times Fighting Ransomware and Cyber Extortion Securing the Internet of Things (IOT) - What is the Real Risk for Enterprise Cyber Security? Making Sense of the EU GDPR Artificial Intelligence - The Latest Threat and Defence in the Cyber Security War Cloud Security - Your Data, Your Responsibility Our speakers on the day include cybersecurity journalist and author Misha Glenny, Chairman of Cyber Essentials Direct and former MP David Blunkett, and many more yet to be announced.  ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102497827-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.334178,,-6.228969,2017-06-28 04:11:26,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,4,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-21 09:00:00,,Secure Computing Forum 2017,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/secure-computing-forum-2017-/E0-001-102497827-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,62 Lansdowne Road,1,V0-001-000223394-8,Aviva Stadium,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/aviva-stadium-/V0-001-000223394-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

But as it&#39;s a gigantic ball of unbelievably hot plasma, 1,400,000 km across, powered by nuclear reactions, it&#39;s also potentially very dangerous. It emits the energy that powers photosynthesis, which is the start of the food chain for all animal life. It&#39;s also the ultimate source for most of the energy generation methods we use on Earth. But it also emits highly energetic charged particles, which are dangerous to astronauts and to pilots and passengers who regularly fly at high altitudes. These particles can also damage electric power supplies and the electronic equipment without which our modern world could not function. It also governs our climate, and even a slight increase or decrease in its energy output would have very serious consequences for us. Will it always go on shining at the steady rate it does now? We also know that some stars explode as novae or supernovae: could that possibly happen to our Sun? On the plus side, though less important, we get rainbows, nice sunsets and the amazing and beautiful aurorae - the Northern and Southern Lights.

Metro Éireann, in collaboration with Duke University’s Kenan Institute of Ethics, invites young writers living in Ireland to submit original works of writing to its third annual intercultural writing competition.  Announcing the 2017 writing competition, Bill McCarthy, coordinator of the project, said, “Writers between the ages of 14 and 21 – immigrants and non-immigrants – are encouraged to enter submissions that explore the ethical challenges associated with intercultural diversity in Ireland.  “Submissions are due by midnight on July 30, 2017, and may take one of three forms: a short story of no more than 2,000 words, a novel extract of no more than 2,000 words or a selection of poetry comprising no more than five poems,” he added.   All submissions must be typed using 12-point Times New Roman font and double-spaced. They should be sent to info@metroeireann.com with the entrant’s full name and the word “submission” in the subject line. Each submission should include a cover page with the entrant’s name, age, address and telephone number. The cover page should also include details about the entrant’s submission, such as its age category and title.  Cash prizes will be awarded in three categories. There will be an ages 14 to 17 winner and runner-up, an ages 18 to 21 winner and runner-up and an ages 14 to 21 Spirit of Intercultural Ethics winner. Each winner will receive 800 euros and each runner-up will receive 400 euros. The winning submissions may also be published in Metro Éireann.  Judges will select winners and runners-up according to a list of criteria: engagement with the themes of ethics and intercultural diversity, creativity and originality, organization and structure, impact on the reader and initiative of beginning writers. Winners will be announced through an awards ceremony on August 4, 2017.   Workshop sessions will be held in Dublin on July 8, 2017, and July 16, 2017, for entrants seeking guidance with their writing. Advanced booking for those sessions is first come, first served.

They call it transatlantic soul.<p>A cross genre multi-instrumentalist, Niall, the songwriter and frontman, grew up on Clare Island off the coast of County Mayo. The insularity of growing up on an island has had a profound effect on his song-writing and thinking in general. He feels that  “the physical isolation tends to make you think more outwardly and look for connections with the wider world.”<p><p>The rest of the band comprises of Hugh Dillon on electric guitar, Dave Duffy on bass and Davie Ryan on drums. Musically, the band share a very coherent outlook having played together in various groups over the last five years including Jazz quartets and Big-Band Soul outfits.<p>Steadfast in developing a solid style that displays the musical skills of each member, the band are motivated by the simplicity of playing ‘for the song’.<p>The band released their album Part of the Light in March 2014 to critical acclaim. Featured as Radio One’s Album of the Week and played extensively across national radio. The band followed national touring with live performances on The Saturday Night Show and Radio One along with a sold out headlining show at The Westport Arts Festival.<p><br><strong>TICKETS</strong><br><br><p>€12 available online from <a href=""http://www.whelanslive.com/index.php/wav-tickets"" rel=""nofollow"">WAV Tickets</a> or Lo-Call <a rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"">1890 200 078</a> (1-7pm M-F)<p>– 50c per ticket service charge applies on phone, internet or creditcard bookings.

Whether you want to promote a business, event or club - or if you just enjoy the challenge of learning something new - our relaxed workshops will show you how a website is put together. Being a course about websites, you’ll be provided with lots of online resources. Every week as new topics are introduced you’ll get plenty of helpful practice problems to keep you going between each workshop. We’ll start off by learning the most common languages for web development, before moving on to setting up on WordPress. After this we’ll cover registering an address and get started with web hosting. To cap everything off we’ll fly through frameworks and learn about the most popular testing tools.   You’re just a click away from making websites in Makeshop.

825,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-03 06:55:58," <p> This is a resolutely New Orleans style from the beginnings of jazz. You&#39;ve found the hottest band to do the earliest jazz in years.<p> The New Orleans Swamp Donkeys are an extremely versatile group of young musicians who play traditional jass, blues, vaudeville, original music, modern jazz adaptations, and many other jazz and New Orleans-derived styles. They started in the authentic, New Orleans, grassroots music scene, playing local festivals and second lines, and transitioned into world-class music programs, festivals, and events, playing in concerts all over the globe. Their sound is enormously accessible with their frontman, the Louis Armstrong-sounding, soulful and sweet James Williams.<br> The Swamp Donkeys can play large and small venues, intimate crowds and boisterous audiences just the same. Formed in the fall of 2012, the band got off to an early start touring nationally in 2013. Then after selling out the Blue Note NYC in February of 2014, the Donkeys released two brand new albums &quot;Swamp Donkey&quot; (all pre-1930s covers) and &quot;Donkey Business&quot; (all original material). They closed out the first weekend of New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival (JazzFest). The group then gained international internet fame when their version of the Game of Thrones theme - performed at B.B. King&#39;s in NYC - went viral, growing past a million views! They followed up this success with a European tour featuring performances at JazzAscona in Switzerland, Vitoria-Gasteiz in Spain, the North Sea Jazz Festival in Netherlands, along with special appearances in France, Spain, and Monaco.<p> In 2015, they did it again, performing at Edinburgh Jazz & Blues Fest, Monte Carlo Sporting Summer Fest, and North Sea Jazz Festivals; along with Ronnie Scott&#39;s in London, The Hamilton in Washington, DC, Cliff Bell&#39;s in Detroit, and many more. Plus, the band recorded an EP with Alia Shawkat; the music video for the title song, A Fine Romance, was nominated for an Offbeat Award for Best Music Video.<p> In 2016, they&#39;ve already performed Jazz à Megève, with French Quarter Fest and JazzFest in New Orleans coming up next.<p> Featuring an all-star cast of fresh, brilliant musicians, The New Orleans Swamp Donkeys bring a remarkable, diverse appearance and sound to the stage with members current and past hailing from around the USA and the world. These are passionate jazz musicians who love the style of a hot 1910s New Orleans speakeasy, all at once resoundingly joyous and independent, soulful and rebellious. Welcome to Original Jass with the New Orleans Swamp Donkeys.</p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103512333-8,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/037/009/408-4.jpeg_/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-08.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-06-10 10:54:48,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-29 23:00:00,,New Orleans Swamp Donkeys,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/new-orleans-swamp-donkeys-/E0-001-103512333-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

The debut album by Chico Science & Nação Zumbi came out in April 1994. The album was a milestone brought about by a group of friends, that, by creating a new scene, kick-started a musical movement that ultimately destabilised the axis of musical production in Brazil. Like other Recife bands, their intent was express the sound of the local trait ‘crabs with brains’, or the ‘mud parabolics’, and everything else that people know, feel, or relate to with the Manguebeat sound. The difference is that this band, from the outskirts of Recife became known worldwide, far more than any other.<br> Thousands of steps and different places later, what was their leitmotiv now is in their essence. Today, the band evoke the Manguebeat but also bring other sounds to life, a harvest tilled for so many years.

Berezovsky’s Dublin show will span across an eclectic group of composers, from Beethoven and Bartok to De Falla and Grieg. Although he is described as a Colossus of Russian piano, the Moscow man holds diversity in music close to his heart. The inherent passion he displays for the individual genius of each artist is palpable in every single performance: Berezovsky believes “Beethoven creates music out of nothingness. I personally like his unbelievable nuclear energy. He is as powerful as the sun.” With such dogged commitment to variety, he will be sure to enchant audiences with this alluring programme of classics from around the globe.    Described by Gramophone magazine as, “The true successor to the great Russian pianists of the past”, the Russian virtuoso will entertain and delight his audience with an astounding solo show. A recipient of the prestigious gold medal in the 1990 International Tchaikovsky Competition at just 21 years old, his prodigious career has since scaled to dizzying heights.   As well as performing with adored orchestras like the Berlin, Los Angeles, New York and Moscow Philharmonic Orchestras; and a myriad of others, he has worked under truly respected conductors like Kurt Masur, Leonard Slatkin and Valery Gergiev. In 2006, he became the winner of the Record Of The Year Award from BBC Music Magazine, and his impressive discography is available on Teldec Classics, Gramophone and Diapason d’Or, among others.    The Dublin PianoFest is also proud to announce that this recital will be in aid of ChildVision, Ireland’s only Centre for Blind and Multi-disabled children who, for over 150 years have been working with families from all over Ireland to provide therapeutic care and residential services for children with sight loss and other significant disabilities, and we are honoured to support the vital work they do.

870,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-07-01 03:46:54," Reactive Rover Course This course is particularly suited to reactive dogs, as we will work on building your dog’s social skills during this course. Because of the nature of this course, places are very limited, so early booking is advisable to avoid disappointment. During REACTIVE ROVER CLASSES we will help you to understand why your dogs react as they do, and show you how to teach them alternate behaviour to barking, lunging, etc. all using reward based, positive reinforcement techniques.  Please be aware that this course is not about finding a ‘Eureka’ moment or ‘fixing’ a reactive dog, but rather it’s about giving you as a dog owner a set of tools that you can use to better handle and manage your dog.  Fee: 4 Week course is €150 Week 1: Does not include your dog. This is an educational hour to learn more about behaviour issues as to why your pet is reacting as they are.  Vaccinations: Proof of yearly boosters up to date Duration: This class is 4 consecutive sessions unless a break is mentioned. Each session is 1 hour per week. Each session will meet on the same day and time each week. Course Material provided: Reactive Rover Exercises Training Notes Email and Telephone Support Class Policies Children We encourage all family members who will be participating in training your dog to attend class. Children can be good trainers but they do require special consideration in a class situation.  There are times when the child will have to sit quietly in class and we want their parents and others to be able to fully concentrate on the class. Multiple Dogs For reasons of safety, we do not allow a single handler to bring multiple dogs to class.

They were both regulars on the infamous Chicago high school party scene, where packed school halls were filled with the sounds of local DJs such as the Hot Mix Five. From the school on to the club, they frequented Ron Hardy’s Muzic Box and started producing music themselves. At some point a friend recommended they visit Larry Sherman, co-owner of Trax Records, and from then on it took a few visits and a discerning dog, but they eventually released their first – and seminal – single Do You Know Who You Are? on Trax in 1989. Under Virgo Four and their aliases M.E. and Ace & Sandman the pair released more music over the next few years, but after a while took up other professions.<p> Over 20 years later Amsterdam’s Rush Hour crew released the seminal re-issue compilation Resurrection, unearthing no less than 30 original Virgo Four tracks, getting the pair the attention they deserve. Virgo Four&#39;s cuts on Rush Hour reconquered the house heads in the exact same way, notably with the Caribou remix of their It&#39;s A Crime track. Now, Eric and new recruit Terry Ivy are continuing the legacy without missing a step.<p><strong>New Jackson</strong><p> Dublin based producer New Jackson’s forthcoming LP for All City, From Night to Night is exactly the kind of house we’re besotted with here at THUMP.

It is aimed at all who work on Construction sites.  The aims of the programme are to: raise the standard of safety awareness in the construction industry ensure that all site personnel after completing the one day awareness programme can make a positive contribution to the prevention of accidents and ill health while working on the site maintain a register of personnel who have received training provide participants with a Safe Pass registration card, indicating that the holder has attended a formal course in health and safety awareness Who pays for the Safe Pass course Generally the employer pays for the Safe Pass course.  The  employer under section 10,25 & 26 of Safety, Health & Welfare at Work Act, 2005 is responsible to allow employees time off from their duties for awareness training as may be reasonable having regard to their health and safety without loss of remuneration. Where can I find Safe Pass trainers? http://www.safetypassgalway.ie/    Prestige Training Galway Tel: 087 - 7950282. When do I need to renew my Safe Pass training? Safe Pass awareness training should be renewed every 4 years. I am only making a delivery to a site do I need Safe Pass? Drivers of vehicles delivering building materials on construction sites must receive Safe Pass training.  Do students and seasonal workers need Safe Pass before working on a Construction site?  If so who should pay? Yes the Safe Pass Programme is aimed at all who work on a construction site, including new entrants.  If a student wants to apply for a job on a construction site for seasonal work they must have the Safe Pass Card.  In this instance they would have to pay for it themselves before they are employed. Can new workers work on site to build up the 6 months experience required for CSCS entry? New entrants to CSCS must complete an initial training programme and are given a log book and New Entrant Card which is red in colour. New entrants must complete a minimum of 6 months training under supervision and maintain a logbook (detailing experience) before completing a final assessment for their CSCS card. Health & Safety in ConstructionThe Solas SafePass Health and Safety Awareness Training Programme is to ensure that, over the course of time, all workers in construction will have a basic knowledge of health and safety, and be able to work on-site without being a risk to themselves or others who might be affected by their acts or omissions. From a health and safety perspective, construction workers are bound by law to hold a valid Safe Pass card. With this Background in mind the programme was developed in consultation with interested parties.The Aims of the programme are focused mainly around health and safety awareness, while the Benefits include an improved safety culture. There are a number of different modules making up the Safe Pass Course Content.Part 1, Section 4 of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work (Construction) Regulations 2013 provides details on the categories of workers that recognise a Safety Awareness Registration Card.  Construction apprentices registered under the Standards Based Apprenticeship Scheme, and trainees undergoing traineeships in the Construction Industry are also required to have a Safety Awareness Registration Card Event cancellations : Please note that a Safe Pass course cannot run without at least 8 candidates under Solas rules.

TESTIMONIALS “Barry was instrumental in the conception and formation of an &#39;innovation engine&#39; at lastminute.com. Not only were we able to identify and develop winning ideas at pace but the whole organization was reinvigorated by an approach which delivered measurable results, doubling revenue for the business.” John Crosby former Chief Product, Trading and Commercial Officer at lastminute.com and Travelocity International “The Google Sprint Master Academy invited Barry to speak to our trainees on coaching and collaborating with senior stakeholders to create space for continuous innovation in the product development lifecycle. He shared advice on leadership, business transformation and inspired our Sprint Masters to push innovation throughout the company” Kai Haley, Lead of Design Relations and Sprint Master Academy, Google “Barry’s approach of driving very early customer testing well ahead of when it would normally be done - in parallel with developing the bigger vision - forces a focus on minimum viable product and early proof points. This proved to be very engaging in our business for stakeholders up to board level. Instead of &#39;here is a big programme - trust us&#39; the message was &#39;here is a game changing initiative and you can touch and feel the first steps of it’. Barry brings a very practical style and methodology to bear which empowered the team - so we really owned the outcome and developed both as a team and as individuals.” John Mornement General Manager at Major International Co. “Barry helped AIB, the largest retail bank in Ireland, achieve a step change in its digital journey. By combining his senior level communication skills with his deep insight on how to leverage technology at scale, he influenced key stakeholders across the bank to do things differently.” Allan Molloy former Head of Customers, Channels and Payments, Allied Irish Bank “Barry has a really synthetic view, which is key to reducing challenges to small iterations that help in getting quick feedback and re-adapting to maximize value. He really understands lean and agile methodologies and sees how they can be used, not only in startups, but even in larger, more complex companies.” Samuel Lacarta Chavarrias Commercial Director, Vueling Airlines “Agility in a digital world is no longer optional and if you don’t embrace experimentation and value based decision making in your market, then someone else will. Barry can take you and your team on a journey towards disrupting the disruptors and then, like us, you will learn to use techniques such as Lean Product Development and Workload Visualisation in order to make the right &quot;customer-based&quot; decisions. These techniques also made us address every aspect of our thinking from just in time architecture towards continuous delivery, hence cutting cycle times in half in order to deliver new products and platforms more frequently. In fact we went from huge twice yearly releases to multiple releases per day. This way of working not only energizes the team but it enables innovation through learning and more importantly builds mutual respect between stakeholders which may be broken.” Fin Goulding, former CIO at PaddyPower BetFair &quot;Barry is exceptionally good at leading teams in the process of new product development. He gets the team to use the lean toolkit to build and test in fast iterations, getting results that may not be achievable in other ways. Barry led a team in delivering  two product development projects at JustGiving and helped us test our ideas very quickly and effectively. He is an excellent coach to the team, leaving everyone energized and more productive after each interaction.&quot;    Anna Kuriakose, former Chief Product Officer at JustGiving “Barry constantly challenged what others held to be sacred in order to deliver a series of rapid proofs of totally new concepts for JustGiving, and together we explored the complex boundary between business fundamentals and software development to forge experimental new practices.” Richard Atkinson, former CIO at JustGiving &quot;I don&#39;t often come away from a workshop with pages of notes that I actually read. This was definitely an exception. What Barry O&#39;Reilly has to say about how organisations can manage their work is invaluable for any business leader.  The &quot;Lean Enterprise&quot; book is packed full of wisdom and Barry&#39;s session captured some of the most important parts in an engaging and entertaining way.&quot; Andy Kelk, CTO, Marketplacer WHAT ELSE?

During the day we do cover essential theory, but we do not dwell on it for too long, we give you a comprehensive manual containing all the notes.  We prefer to focus on getting you on your feet as often as possible.  In addition to presenting at the beginning and end of the day, there will also be opportunities to be on your feet more informally throughout the day. The masterclass takes one full action-packed day. On both occasions when you are videoed we give you 1 to 1 feedback, in a separate room, as well as making your training videos available to you after the course. You will learn how to: Identify and enhance your natural style Increase self-confidence Control your nerves Connect with your audience  Use the 3S&#39;s of presenting Get and hold attention Develop natural body language Maximise your vocal impact Structure a presentation effectively Open and close in 8 different ways In order to strike the best balance between personal attention and supportive group dynamics we limit workshop attendees to 8.

Help your client to explore how their Three Circles interact and what capacity they have to regulate each other. Develop historical formulations with your client, including helping them to explore how each of the Circles developed, the Safety Strategies they use to regulate their emotions and the intended and unintended consequences of these strategies. To help your client explore their “Multiple Mind” and how different parts of the self interact. Use your clients Compassionate Mind to help the formulation process and to help you client manage multiple mind conflicts. Help your client develop their own skills in CFT Formulation to help them manage the challenges of life in the longer term.   Teaching Methods: The workshop consists of didactic teaching, video demonstrations and role play.  The focus is on developing your practical CFT formulation skills so please bring anonymised clinical examples to discuss. Compassion Focused Therapy and Compassionate Mind Training Compassion focused therapy is derived from the evolutionary model of social mentality therapy (Gilbert 1989, 1995, 2005a,b, 2007). CFT was developed to help people who frequently experience shame and self-criticism.  These factors have been associated with the development and maintenance of a range of mental health problems, and are often difficult to treat using traditional psychotherapeutic approaches. CFT is a scientific model that draws on many branches of psychology (e.g., developmental social and evolutionary) and neuroscience. It has a specific formulation model that notes that internal and external experiences can activate our &quot;threat&quot; system. We find various ways to manage these painful emotions and thoughts as best we can.  Sometimes this can lead to unintended consequences that can exacerbate our problems and can make it even more difficult to manage life’s challenges. Key to CFT is the idea that we have evolved with a brain and emotional systems that can very difficult to manage, and that much of the way we respond to the world is not our fault, but our (often automatic) responses to threat.  However understanding these responses can help us to take responsibility for the ways we respond to threat, and find new, more adaptive, ways of coping. CFT is designed to help clinicians develop therapeutic relationships that are most likely to be helpful for people who experience high levels of shame and self-criticism, or who find compassion and receiving care from others (including their therapist) difficult to manage. It is an integrative approach, utilising the wisdom of both Western and Eastern approaches to helping people change. CFT argues that we can be taught to train our minds (Compassionate Mind Training) to help us to experience compassion, develop various aspects of compassion for ourselves and others, improve our abilities to self-sooth and affiliate with others, and to foster the courage and wisdom we need to cope with difficult life events, memories or emotions. To find out more about CFT you can visit the Compassionate Mind Foundation Website at www.compassionatemind.co.uk.  It has lots of useful information about the model, training materials, links to key papers and commonly used measures, and to clinicians and researchers working in with compassion around the world.   Recommended Reading Gilbert, P.

AUDIENCE Executives interested in strategy, leadership, organizational culture and good governance Directors of Product, Technology, IT and Operations Anyone working in program or project management, including members of the PMO Product Development teams and leaders ABOUT YOUR FACILITATOR Barry O’Reilly is a business advisor, entrepreneur, and author who has pioneered the intersection of business model innovation, product development, organizational design, and culture transformation. Barry works with business leaders and teams from global organizations that seek to invent the future, not fear it. Every day, Barry works with many of the world’s leading companies to break the vicious cycles that spiral businesses toward death by enabling experimentation and learning to unlock the insights required for better decision making and higher performance and results. Barry is co-author of the international bestseller Lean Enterprise: How High Performance Organizations Innovate at Scale—included in the Eric Ries Lean series, and a Harvard Business Review must read for CEOs and business leaders. He is an internationally sought-after speaker, frequent writer and contributor to The Economist, Strategy+Business,and MIT Sloan Management Review. Barry is Faculty at Singularity University, advising and coaching on Singularity&#39;s executive and accelerator programs based in San Francisco, and throughout the globe.  Barry is also founder and CEO of ExecCamp, the entrepreneurial experience for executives, and management consultancy Antennae. His mission is to help purposeful technology-led businesses innovate at scale. TESTIMONIALS “Barry was instrumental in the conception and formation of an &#39;innovation engine&#39; at lastminute.com. Not only were we able to identify and develop winning ideas at pace but the whole organization was reinvigorated by an approach which delivered measurable results, doubling revenue for the business.” John Crosby former Chief Product, Trading and Commercial Officer at lastminute.com and Travelocity International “The Google Sprint Master Academy invited Barry to speak to our trainees on coaching and collaborating with senior stakeholders to create space for continuous innovation in the product development lifecycle. He shared advice on leadership, business transformation and inspired our Sprint Masters to push innovation throughout the company” Kai Haley, Lead of Design Relations and Sprint Master Academy, Google “Barry’s approach of driving very early customer testing well ahead of when it would normally be done - in parallel with developing the bigger vision - forces a focus on minimum viable product and early proof points. This proved to be very engaging in our business for stakeholders up to board level. Instead of &#39;here is a big programme - trust us&#39; the message was &#39;here is a game changing initiative and you can touch and feel the first steps of it’. Barry brings a very practical style and methodology to bear which empowered the team - so we really owned the outcome and developed both as a team and as individuals.” John Mornement General Manager at Major International Co. “Barry helped AIB, the largest retail bank in Ireland, achieve a step change in its digital journey. By combining his senior level communication skills with his deep insight on how to leverage technology at scale, he influenced key stakeholders across the bank to do things differently.” Allan Molloy former Head of Customers, Channels and Payments, Allied Irish Bank “Barry has a really synthetic view, which is key to reducing challenges to small iterations that help in getting quick feedback and re-adapting to maximize value. He really understands lean and agile methodologies and sees how they can be used, not only in startups, but even in larger, more complex companies.” Samuel Lacarta Chavarrias Commercial Director, Vueling Airlines “Agility in a digital world is no longer optional and if you don’t embrace experimentation and value based decision making in your market, then someone else will. Barry can take you and your team on a journey towards disrupting the disruptors and then, like us, you will learn to use techniques such as Lean Product Development and Workload Visualisation in order to make the right &quot;customer-based&quot; decisions. These techniques also made us address every aspect of our thinking from just in time architecture towards continuous delivery, hence cutting cycle times in half in order to deliver new products and platforms more frequently. In fact we went from huge twice yearly releases to multiple releases per day. This way of working not only energizes the team but it enables innovation through learning and more importantly builds mutual respect between stakeholders which may be broken.” Fin Goulding, former CIO at PaddyPower BetFair &quot;Barry is exceptionally good at leading teams in the process of new product development. He gets the team to use the lean toolkit to build and test in fast iterations, getting results that may not be achievable in other ways. Barry led a team in delivering  two product development projects at JustGiving and helped us test our ideas very quickly and effectively. He is an excellent coach to the team, leaving everyone energized and more productive after each interaction.&quot;    Anna Kuriakose, former Chief Product Officer at JustGiving “Barry constantly challenged what others held to be sacred in order to deliver a series of rapid proofs of totally new concepts for JustGiving, and together we explored the complex boundary between business fundamentals and software development to forge experimental new practices.” Richard Atkinson, former CIO at JustGiving &quot;I don&#39;t often come away from a workshop with pages of notes that I actually read. This was definitely an exception. What Barry O&#39;Reilly has to say about how organisations can manage their work is invaluable for any business leader.  The &quot;Lean Enterprise&quot; book is packed full of wisdom and Barry&#39;s session captured some of the most important parts in an engaging and entertaining way.&quot; Andy Kelk, CTO, Marketplacer WHAT ELSE?

They began playing every Monday in the Leeson Lounge, playing mostly a version of New Orleans R’n’B with a classic rock twist, sandwiched with swing, Rock’n’Roll, Soul, Funk, Blues and rap of all eras.Their sets consists of radical reworkings of well known R’n’B standards which segue into lengthy improvisations that are one minute, blues jazz crescendo, the next a funk dervish, one minute a pyschedelic freak out, next a country boogie twist, the next a dark ascension of Wagnerian majesty.<p>Featuring some the best musicians Ireland has ever produced, Dublin Blue cartel are:<p>James delaney (James has played with Sharon Shannon, Van Morrison, Paul Brady, Chuck Berry, Andrew Strong)<p>Pat Farrell: Lead Guitar (The Business, Red Peters). Pat had shared stages with B.B. King, Jeff Healy, John Primer and Carlos Johnson<p>John Quearney: Bass (Donovan, Heavy Waits, The Business, Left right n Centre,)<p>Noel Bridgeman: Drums. Noel was a founding member of Skid Row, one of the most important Irish rock bands, whose members included Gary Moore, Phill Lynott and Brush Shields. He has also recorded with Van Morrison, Steve Earle, Sharon Shannon and has played with Mary Black and many other legendary Irish artists.<p>Mick Pyro is a member of Republic of Loose who have had three top ten albums in Ireland, one reaching number 2.

935,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-06 10:26:06," Presented by Rub A Dub Hi-Fi and The Big Blue Bus with special thanks to Saoirse Sounds. Johnny Osbourne is a veteran artist who has been recording hits since the 1970s and is well-known to Reggae lovers worldwide for his beautiful melodies, conscious lyrics and crucial dubplates from the 80s and 90s which have left hundreds of soundboys weeping. This is a gig not to be missed at any cost Johnny Osbourne&#39;s voice is a soundtrack to the history of Reggae music and a crucial link to the foundation of Soundsystem Culture. Johnny Osbourne attended the Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica that also was home to Yellowman, founding members of the Skatalites, Leroy Smart and Leroy Horsemouth Wallace as well as Jazz men Dizzy Reece and Joe Harriott. During 1967 Osbourne became lead vocalist of The Wildcats, and recorded for producer Winston Riley, although nothing was issued. The Wildcats&#39; manager then financed a session at Coxsone Dodd&#39;s Studio One, from which his debut single, &quot;All I Have Is Love&quot;, was released. In 1969 he recorded an album, Come Back Darling, again for Riley. On the day that he completed the album, Osbourne emigrated to Toronto, Canada, to join his family. After singing with various soul and reggae groups, he became lead vocalist for Ishan People, and recorded two albums with them. The group broke up in 1979, and Osbourne decided to return to Jamaica. Shortly after returning, he recorded &quot;Forgive Them&quot; and &quot;Jealousy, Heartache And Pain&quot; for the Studio One label. Through late 1979 and early 1980 he recorded extensively for Dodd, with these sessions culminating in Truths And Rights. In 1979 he also had a hit for King Jammy (then Prince Jammy) with &quot;Folly Ranking&quot;, and an album of the same name followed in 1980. The success of these recordings made him one of the most in-demand vocalists on the island, and a glut of material was released, including Fally Lover, Warrior, Innah Disco Style and Never Stop Fighting, between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, he began the year with two big hits, &quot;Yo Yo&quot; and &quot;Lend Me A Chopper&quot;, and later in the year enjoyed further success with &quot;Water Pumping&quot;, an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis&#39; &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, which had also served as the basis for Johnny Clarke&#39;s 1976 hit &quot;Rockers Time Now&quot;. The hits continued with &quot;Get Cracking&quot;, &quot;Check For You&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; (1984), &quot;Buddy Bye&quot;, &quot;No Sound Like We&quot; and &quot;In The Area&quot; (1985).

936,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-02 17:43:17," The Theme of Sustainability within the Medtech processing and manufacturing sector has never been more important! For many years larger organisations have been realising the fact that environmental policies and energy efficiencies within processing is directly related to the bottom line! Reducing energy costs, carbon footprint and waste during the process of Medtech devices can have a significant impact on the profitability of a facility. Additionally, as Medtech manufacturers and their clients supply chains becomes more and more entwined they find themselves under increased pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Significant financial savings can be achieved through increased energy efficiency. (OFGEM forecast energy prices to rise by 20% by 2020) Enhanced marketing opportunities. Making your business and brands stand out from the crowd. Sustainability encompasses some of the most robust energy management systems, enabling continual improvements on energy performance. Reducing carbon footprint and carbon tax. Reduced reliance on suppliers through improved waste & water management. Adoption of ISO9001, ISO14001 & ISO50001.

Kevin incorporates information from young people with ASD to help shape and inform practice.As the pressures increase on our children, more and more children with ASD become school refusers.  In this interactive workshop, we look at the reasons why children may refuse to attend school, we explore ways to keep our children within school but then strategies and approaches to use to ease them back.Discussions will take place around ways to use Special Interests, developing Neuro-harmony amongst students (and staff), developing Child Centered Planning systems to help children look at possibilities but also looking at what the community, the family and the educational establishment needs to do to build confidence for all.At the end of this workshop participants will have seen: approaches that are having positive impacts elsewhere and therefore had been involved in discussions on how to make this work locally a variety of strategies and resources used to build trust, confidence in young people with ASD important tools to measure practice, progression and competency in order for establishments to be able to see where they are and what they need to do.

And what will it do for you?Kinetic Shift is a rapid method combining several different techniques to resolve Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, Weight Loss, Smoking and even PTSD and much more. We all know that we can’t express everything we want to verbally, so we use several other methods of communication and that is key to Kinetic Shift.Who can use it? Everyone from Beginners to Seasoned therapists….. it&#39;s so simple and fun you can do it anywhere.Sub-modalities, Confusion, Metaphors, Shamanistic, Intuition and Theatrical are what make up Kinetic Shift a complete opposite to the classically trained methods you see….. Clients love it and so do the practitioners. &quot;I attended the 2 day Kinetic Shift course and the only words I can use to describre this are Amazing, Fantastic and Life Changing . Fabolous weekend, learning so much, building confidence and meeting so many interesting like minded people&quot; Susan Watson &quot;I first attender this course a year ago and all of a sudden it made hypnosis and my therapy business feel &quot;fresh&quot; again Key is the level of particiption, the energy is high and everyone leaves confident to apply the techniques immediately. I recommend this 100%&quot; Matt Gilbert   Kinetic Shift was developed by Karl Smith after years and years of watching and participating in boring and really pathetic hypnotherapy methods, laying the client down and really boring them to death with long-winded scripts or monotone voices. After 2 years of field testing with Military and Emergency Services personnel, he finalised the 7 simplistic stages of Kinetic Shift.  Watch this video of Karl Smith (Founder of UK Hypnosis Academy) and Ivan L. Fernandez (UK Hypnosis Academy Trainer) Hypnotherapy Scripts are great but they should be thrown out at the earliest point in a hypnotherapists career, as they offer little except words and pacing. Which is great, but then you have to develop, and that&#39;s where Kinetic Shift fits in……by Developing Confidence and Speed in a therapist work, also working intuitively with your clients…. making them feel special.Now, what will this technique do? Compared to the Classical lay down and keep quiet Hypnotherapy, It will get the client to participate. Remember Hypnosis is not a state of eyelids…. their eyes can be open, so most of the work in Kinetic Shift is eyes open.Kinetic Shift gets the intuitive part of the therapist into overdrive watching every move, every twitch, every eye movement and emotion the client displays during your session and ensures that by the time they leave you, you the therapist, they will know there life is changed…..its fun!Use the Clients feelings and emotions, use their State ……Work directly with the MIND, Not the Cognitive part of the brain that will lie or cover up.No more….. “I went to a therapist and I laid there and It didn’t work!” With Kinetic Shift, they will know something happened.Kinetic Shift is broken down into 7 stages and will bring your therapy sessions to life, that is a fact! Your clients will love it….WHY? It&#39;s fun and they can feel Kinetic Shift as is happens.With 100’s of people trained in 7 countries (to date) and not one therapist has said, &quot;I can’t use it.&quot; It will bring your sessions to life and WILL bring you more clients…. because the last thing your client will remember is an extraordinary experience and amazing sensation.Kinetic Shift will do 2 things…..Give YOUR client a fun and life-changing session, and also change the way you work and feel in a session, it brings out the passion you have in a therapy room!Describing Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic and Energising. I guarantee you will change the way you work, you will practice, practice, practice and you will have immense fun on this course. &quot;Brilliant. Love it. Would recommend to any therapists. Had so much fun and met some amazing people. I learned so much. Worth every penny. Thank you.&quot; Lorna Cracknell   &quot;If you are in the business of helping people, then you are missing a powerful tool if Kinetic Shift is not yet in your arsenal. The 2 days spent with Karl and his team drive your confidence through the roof as you learn change happens fast and easy.

The son of a farm labourer, Ledwidge was born in a labourer’s cottage in Slane, Co Meath, and worked as a farm labourer, a miner and a road worker while writing the poems that were starting to bring him fame before he died just before his 30th birthday, having lived to see only one book of his poems in print, which he received while existing of starvation rations in Serbia in the freezing winter of 1914. A committed Irish nationalist, Ledwidge enlisted in the Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914, endured the slaughter of Gallipoli and was recovering from injuries in a Manchester Hospital when word reached him of the Easter Rising, inspiring his most famous poem for his friend and fellow poet, Thomas MacDonagh.<p><br>The poet, novelist and playwright Dermot Bolger has long been a champion and admirer of the work of Francis Ledwidge. He is the editor of the recently republished <a href=""http://newisland.ie/product/francis-ledwidge-selected-poems/"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external""><strong>Francis Ledwidge: Selected Poem,</strong></a> for which he also wrote a lengthy personal afterword describing the influence of Ledwidge on his own life and work. In this tribute to Francis Ledwidge Bolger will discuss Ledwidge’s life and enduring reputation in an evening interspersed with music and readings of some of Ledwidge’s finest poems.<br><p>All welcome!

964,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-02 17:43:17," The Theme of Sustainability within the Medtech processing and manufacturing sector has never been more important! For many years larger organisations have been realising the fact that environmental policies and energy efficiencies within processing is directly related to the bottom line! Reducing energy costs, carbon footprint and waste during the process of Medtech devices can have a significant impact on the profitability of a facility. Additionally, as Medtech manufacturers and their clients supply chains becomes more and more entwined they find themselves under increased pressure to reduce their carbon footprint. Significant financial savings can be achieved through increased energy efficiency. (OFGEM forecast energy prices to rise by 20% by 2020) Enhanced marketing opportunities. Making your business and brands stand out from the crowd. Sustainability encompasses some of the most robust energy management systems, enabling continual improvements on energy performance.

965,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-06 10:26:06," Presented by Rub A Dub Hi-Fi and The Big Blue Bus with special thanks to Saoirse Sounds. Johnny Osbourne is a veteran artist who has been recording hits since the 1970s and is well-known to Reggae lovers worldwide for his beautiful melodies, conscious lyrics and crucial dubplates from the 80s and 90s which have left hundreds of soundboys weeping. This is a gig not to be missed at any cost Johnny Osbourne&#39;s voice is a soundtrack to the history of Reggae music and a crucial link to the foundation of Soundsystem Culture. Johnny Osbourne attended the Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica that also was home to Yellowman, founding members of the Skatalites, Leroy Smart and Leroy Horsemouth Wallace as well as Jazz men Dizzy Reece and Joe Harriott. During 1967 Osbourne became lead vocalist of The Wildcats, and recorded for producer Winston Riley, although nothing was issued. The Wildcats&#39; manager then financed a session at Coxsone Dodd&#39;s Studio One, from which his debut single, &quot;All I Have Is Love&quot;, was released. In 1969 he recorded an album, Come Back Darling, again for Riley. On the day that he completed the album, Osbourne emigrated to Toronto, Canada, to join his family. After singing with various soul and reggae groups, he became lead vocalist for Ishan People, and recorded two albums with them. The group broke up in 1979, and Osbourne decided to return to Jamaica. Shortly after returning, he recorded &quot;Forgive Them&quot; and &quot;Jealousy, Heartache And Pain&quot; for the Studio One label. Through late 1979 and early 1980 he recorded extensively for Dodd, with these sessions culminating in Truths And Rights. In 1979 he also had a hit for King Jammy (then Prince Jammy) with &quot;Folly Ranking&quot;, and an album of the same name followed in 1980. The success of these recordings made him one of the most in-demand vocalists on the island, and a glut of material was released, including Fally Lover, Warrior, Innah Disco Style and Never Stop Fighting, between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, he began the year with two big hits, &quot;Yo Yo&quot; and &quot;Lend Me A Chopper&quot;, and later in the year enjoyed further success with &quot;Water Pumping&quot;, an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis&#39; &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, which had also served as the basis for Johnny Clarke&#39;s 1976 hit &quot;Rockers Time Now&quot;. The hits continued with &quot;Get Cracking&quot;, &quot;Check For You&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; (1984), &quot;Buddy Bye&quot;, &quot;No Sound Like We&quot; and &quot;In The Area&quot; (1985). In the late 1980s he was particularly successful when recording for Bobby Digital, and had hits with &quot;Good Time Rock&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rude Boy Skank&quot; (1988), both of which are included on his 1989 album, Rougher Than Them. Throughout the 1980s he continued to record for Coxsone Dodd, and singles included &quot;Keep That Light&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;A We Run Things&quot;, but a long-promised second album from Dodd has not materialized. ______________________________________________________________________ Tickets €20 available from Eventbrite and the Big Blue Bus in the Bernard Shaw and at festivals across the country.

Kevin incorporates information from young people with ASD to help shape and inform practice.As the pressures increase on our children, more and more children with ASD become school refusers.  In this interactive workshop, we look at the reasons why children may refuse to attend school, we explore ways to keep our children within school but then strategies and approaches to use to ease them back.Discussions will take place around ways to use Special Interests, developing Neuro-harmony amongst students (and staff), developing Child Centered Planning systems to help children look at possibilities but also looking at what the community, the family and the educational establishment needs to do to build confidence for all.At the end of this workshop participants will have seen: approaches that are having positive impacts elsewhere and therefore had been involved in discussions on how to make this work locally a variety of strategies and resources used to build trust, confidence in young people with ASD important tools to measure practice, progression and competency in order for establishments to be able to see where they are and what they need to do.

WHY MEDITATE? Many of us are living busy lives and tend to often be in our heads with a constant stream of thoughts. We often forget to check in with ourselves, to be present and aware of whom we truly are.  Meditation can help you to: ~ manage stress ~ be happier ~ be healthier ~ be present ~ be more focussed ~ create inner peace ~ sleep better Structure of the Meditation Classes: Each class is run as a complete meditation practice and will include discussion of the practices, guided meditations, and contemplation. The practices used aim to create balance between body and mind. The classes are open to everyone who is interested in meditation, whether you are a complete beginner or have experience with meditation. Japanese Meditation Practices: The meditation practices used in these classes are based on the Japanese Energetic System, also called The Three Diamonds. The focus is on three energy centres, the Hara (belly), the head and the heart. In Japanese meditation practices the body-mind connection is central: the techniques used help you to get out of your head and bring your awareness back into your body. This helps focus the mind and helps you to become more grounded and present. The techniques used are characterised by simplicity. Elements we work with include utilising breath, Ki (energy) cultivation and awareness, precepts (way of being). Practical Info No need to bring anything. Just wear comfortable clothing (lockers and changing facilities are available). When you arrive, please ring the bell marked “studios”. The class is in Studio 2 on the first floor. Please arrive on time or a few minutes early so meditations will not be interrupted. The classes are led by Tessa van Keeken of Lift Your Spirit, an experienced meditation teacher. She also is a qualified Holistic Therapist, Life Coach, NLP Practitioner and Reiki Master & Teacher.

WHY MEDITATE? Many of us are living busy lives and tend to often be in our heads with a constant stream of thoughts. We often forget to check in with ourselves, to be present and aware of whom we truly are.  Meditation can help you to: ~ manage stress ~ be happier ~ be healthier ~ be present ~ be more focussed ~ create inner peace ~ sleep better Structure of the Meditation Classes: Each class is run as a complete meditation practice and will include discussion of the practices, guided meditations, and contemplation. The practices used aim to create balance between body and mind. The classes are open to everyone who is interested in meditation, whether you are a complete beginner or have experience with meditation. Japanese Meditation Practices: The meditation practices used in these classes are based on the Japanese Energetic System, also called The Three Diamonds. The focus is on three energy centres, the Hara (belly), the head and the heart. In Japanese meditation practices the body-mind connection is central: the techniques used help you to get out of your head and bring your awareness back into your body. This helps focus the mind and helps you to become more grounded and present. The techniques used are characterised by simplicity. Elements we work with include utilising breath, Ki (energy) cultivation and awareness, precepts (way of being). Practical Info No need to bring anything. Just wear comfortable clothing (lockers and changing facilities are available). When you arrive, please ring the bell marked “studios”. The class is in Studio 2 on the first floor. Please arrive on time or a few minutes early so meditations will not be interrupted. The classes are led by Tessa van Keeken of Lift Your Spirit, an experienced meditation teacher. She also is a qualified Holistic Therapist, Life Coach, NLP Practitioner and Reiki Master & Teacher.

989,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-17 15:30:34," <p> Produced by Metallica’s Robert Trujillo in association with Passion Pictures, JACO includes some incredible insights from an array of artists including Flea, Joni Mitchell, Sting, Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, Geddy Lee, Bootsy Collins, Carlos Santana and others as well as Jaco’s family, and friends. It unveils the story of his music, his life, his demise, and ultimately the fragility of great artistic genius.<p> There are few musicians who fundamentally change their instrument, and even fewer still who transcend their instrument altogether. Jaco Pastorius did both.<p> In 1976, Jaco’s melodic “singing” bass style redefined the role of the bass in modern music. Almost overnight, critics hailed Jaco Pastorius as “the future of modern music,” alongside popular visionaries like David Bowie, Tom Waits, Patti Smith, Bryan Ferry, Lou Reed, and Herbie Hancock.<p> Driven only by his own desire to create the music he wanted to hear, Jaco transformed himself from a poor and unknown, scrappy Florida boy, into an international sensation — all without any formal musical training. Instead of chasing popular music, Jaco led his fans towards the music inside him. Defiantly jumping off amplifiers, heaving his bass through the air, and refusing to be just a “sideman,” Jaco broke down the barriers between audiences and genres.<p> Unfortunately, for many of our most sensitive artists, great genius comes at great cost… and Jaco Pastorius was no exception.<p> Now over 25 years since his violent and untimely death, his story will teach the world about true musicianship, family, and the indestructible power of the human spirit.</p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103889448-2,[None],53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-06-17 15:30:34,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-10 20:00:00,,JACO - The Jaco Pastorius Documentary,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/jaco-jaco-pastorius-documentary-/E0-001-103889448-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

999,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-15 10:15:57," In the spirit of the 1960’s Scratch Orchestra, join us at Science Gallery Dublin for a day of music exploration with a hands-on music instrument workshop and short improvisatory rehearsal and performance. Each orchestra will be led by an Irish composer in conjunction with Dabbledoo Music and The Contemporary Music Centre. For this workshop, no instrumental skills are not necessary, nor the ability to read music – merely curiosity and the wish to make and play music. The Scratch Orchestra grew out of a series of music composition classes held at London’s Morley College. The classes were instigated by Cornelius Cardew, Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton and were attended by avant-garde musicians and artists interested in exploring sound. From this, in July 1969, the Scratch Orchestra was formed; it was described, in its draft constitution, as “a large number of enthusiasts pooling their resources (not primarily material resources) and assembling for action (music making, performance, edification.)” No experience required but this event is strictly over 15s.  ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103814788-9,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/737/538-5.png_/make-play-orchestra-38.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/737/538-5.png_/make-play-orchestra-38.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/737/538-5.png_/make-play-orchestra-38.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/737/538-5.png_/make-play-orchestra-38.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3438481,,-6.2478605,2017-06-15 10:15:57,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-15 10:00:00,,MAKE IT.

1004,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-24 04:39:12," Professor Evan Stark is a sociologist, forensic social worker, award-winning researcher and the leading global expert on coercive control in the context of domestic violence and abuse. His book Coercive Control: The Entrapment of Women in Personal Life has been cited as one of the most important books ever written on domestic violence/abuse as it breaks through entrenched views of physical abuse that have ultimately failed to protect women.  Professor Stark argues that we need to reframe domestic abuse to see it as more than a &quot;fight&quot;. He argues it is a pattern of behaviour which seeks to take away the victim’s liberty or freedom, to strip away their sense of self. It is not just women’s bodily integrity which is violated but also their human rights. Professor Stark has advised the English, Welsh and Scottish governments in developing their new and emerging coercive control laws. This seminar will be of benefit to you if your work ever involves providing services or support to women and their children. It is been designed to help deepen understanding and strengthen participants skills to recognise and respond to the signs and dynamics of coercive control which is often the most pervasive and unrecognised form of abuse of women in their relationships.

Because of the nature of this course, places are very limited, so early booking is advisable to avoid disappointment. During REACTIVE ROVER CLASSES we will help you to understand why your dogs react as they do, and show you how to teach them alternate behaviour to barking, lunging, etc. all using reward based, positive reinforcement techniques.  Please be aware that this course is not about finding a ‘Eureka’ moment or ‘fixing’ a reactive dog, but rather it’s about giving you as a dog owner a set of tools that you can use to better handle and manage your dog.  Fee: 4 Week course is €150 Week 1: Does not include your dog. This is an educational hour to learn more about behaviour issues as to why your pet is reacting as they are.  Vaccinations: Proof of yearly boosters up to date Duration: This class is 4 consecutive sessions unless a break is mentioned. Each session is 1 hour per week. Each session will meet on the same day and time each week. Course Material provided: Reactive Rover Exercises Training Notes Email and Telephone Support Class Policies Children We encourage all family members who will be participating in training your dog to attend class. Children can be good trainers but they do require special consideration in a class situation.  There are times when the child will have to sit quietly in class and we want their parents and others to be able to fully concentrate on the class. Multiple Dogs For reasons of safety, we do not allow a single handler to bring multiple dogs to class. If you have multiple dogs, please ensure that you have multiple handlers – one for each dog.  Refunds Classes are non-refundable  Transfering  If you do choose to transfer to another class start date or location there is a transfer fee of €10.00  Make-Up Sessions Make-up sessions are always possible!

They were both regulars on the infamous Chicago high school party scene, where packed school halls were filled with the sounds of local DJs such as the Hot Mix Five. From the school on to the club, they frequented Ron Hardy’s Muzic Box and started producing music themselves. At some point a friend recommended they visit Larry Sherman, co-owner of Trax Records, and from then on it took a few visits and a discerning dog, but they eventually released their first – and seminal – single Do You Know Who You Are? on Trax in 1989. Under Virgo Four and their aliases M.E. and Ace & Sandman the pair released more music over the next few years, but after a while took up other professions.<p> Over 20 years later Amsterdam’s Rush Hour crew released the seminal re-issue compilation Resurrection, unearthing no less than 30 original Virgo Four tracks, getting the pair the attention they deserve. Virgo Four&#39;s cuts on Rush Hour reconquered the house heads in the exact same way, notably with the Caribou remix of their It&#39;s A Crime track. Now, Eric and new recruit Terry Ivy are continuing the legacy without missing a step.<p><strong>New Jackson</strong><p> Dublin based producer New Jackson’s forthcoming LP for All City, From Night to Night is exactly the kind of house we’re besotted with here at THUMP.

John F Ryan, Director, at the European Commission Health and Food Safety Directorate General Directorate C – Public Health and Crisis Management will give a keynote address on European priorities in the environment and health nexus.  We will also hear from Dr Simon O’Rafferty on a product design led approach to successful public engagement, and Dr Easkey Britton who is a researcher at the NUIG Whitaker Inst. Working on Social Innovation, Participation and Policy.  The conference will also include a series of presentations from practice based experience in engaging with citizen led science and communities followed by a panel and audience led discussion on addressing benefits, challenges and needs for such engagement. This Conference is a free event aimed at HSE and EPA staff working in the Health, Wellbeing and citizen engagement area, as well as for NGOs and Academics. Successfully engaging citizens and communities is enormously challenging, yet without such engagement, the essential transition to sustainable and healthy living is impossible.  This year’s conference follows on from a successful event in 2016, the presentations from which are available to view and download at:    http://www.epa-pictaural.com/nav/sHse16.php ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104256279-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/865/334-1.jpeg_/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-34.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3406799,,-6.2684350,2017-06-30 08:12:00,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-11-29 09:00:00,,HSE-EPA ENVIRONMENT & HEALTH CONFERENCE 2017,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/hseepa-environment-health-conference-2017-/E0-001-104256279-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Golden Lane Dublin 8,1,V0-001-000622006-7,Radisson SAS Royal Hotel Dublin,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/radisson-sas-royal-hotel-dublin-/V0-001-000622006-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

As the hall grew in popularity its free-spirited reputation brought it to the attention of the church and politicians who forced Jimmy to flee and the hall to close.<p>A decade later, at the height of the Depression, Jimmy returns from the US. The hall stands abandoned but as Jimmy sees the poverty and growing oppression in the village, the leader and activist within him is stirred.

Director and co-screenwriter Quentin Tarantino synthesized such seemingly disparate traditions as the syncopated language of David Mamet; the serious violence of American gangster movies, crime movies, and films noirs mixed up with the wacky violence of cartoons, video games, and Japanese animation; and the fragmented story-telling structures of such experimental classics as Citizen Kane, Rashomon, and La jetée. The Oscar-winning script by Tarantino and Roger Avary intertwines three stories, featuring Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta, in the role that single-handedly reignited his career, as hit men who have philosophical interchanges on such topics as the French names for American fast food products; Bruce Willis as a boxer out of a 1940s B-movie; and such other stalwarts as Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Christopher Walken, Eric Stoltz, Ving Rhames, and Uma Thurman, whose dance sequence with Travolta proved an instant classic</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104040780-9,[None],53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-06-24 17:15:27,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-01 19:45:00,,Tarantino Week : A Night of Pulp Fiction,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/tarantino-week-night-pulp-fiction-/E0-001-104040780-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

In that time they have collaborated live with the likes of Damo Suzuki, Iva Bittova & Charles Hayward while slowly drifting over the course of six albums from a pastoral psychedelia to full-on kosmische psych, fully realised on ‘Master’ their 2015 aural colossus. Drawing from the same sonic palette, Tough Love is another serpentine & ecstatic creation from one of Ireland’s most consistently adventurous bands.</p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103888451-9,[None],53.3466761,,-6.2632464,2017-06-17 19:25:55,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,Dublin 1,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-08 20:00:00,,The Jimmy Cake,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/jimmy-cake-/E0-001-103888451-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,35 Lower Liffey Street,1,V0-001-004645599-7,The Grand Social (Formerly Pravda),http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-grand-social-formerly-pravda-/V0-001-004645599-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

His crime was to build a dance hall where he encouraged the local community to learn, to argue and to dream, but above all to dance and have fun. As the hall grew in popularity its free-spirited reputation brought it to the attention of the church and politicians who forced Jimmy to flee and the hall to close.<p>A decade later, at the height of the Depression, Jimmy returns from the US. The hall stands abandoned but as Jimmy sees the poverty and growing oppression in the village, the leader and activist within him is stirred. He decides to reopen the hall, and so takes on the established authorities of the church and the government. <p><i>Jimmy’s Hall</i> will have its first performances in <a href=""https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/whats_on/event/jimmys-hall-leitrim"" title=""Carrick-on-Shannon Community School"" rel=""nofollow"">Carrick-on-Shannon Community School</a> before coming to Dublin.<br><strong>Jimmy’s Hall Rehearsals</strong><br><p><br><strong>Booking Information for Jimmy’s Hall</strong><br><p>28 July – 19 August<br><a href=""https://www.abbeytheatre.ie/free-first-previews/"" title=""Free First Preview: 28 July "" rel=""nofollow"">Free First Preview: 28 July </a><br> on the Abbey stage<p>Times: Mon – Sat 7.30pm, Matinees Sat 2pm<br> Tickets: €13 – €45 / Conc. €13 – €25<p><b>Sign language interpreted performance</b>: Thursday 17 August, 7.30pm<br><b>Audio-described and captioned performance</b>: Saturday 19 August, 2pm<a href=""http://booking.abbeytheatre.ie/single/PSDetail.aspx?psn=8129"" title=""Performance times"" rel=""nofollow"">Book Now</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-098305367-2,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/035/667/105-4.jpeg_/jimmys-hall-05.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/035/667/105-4.jpeg_/jimmys-hall-05.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/035/667/105-4.jpeg_/jimmys-hall-05.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/035/667/105-4.jpeg_/jimmys-hall-05.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3485,,-6.25724,2017-06-24 14:30:29,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,Dublin 1,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-29 00:00:00,2017-08-19 00:00:00,Jimmy’s Hall,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/jimmys-hall-/E0-001-098305367-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,26 Lower Abbey Street,1,V0-001-000213946-6,Abbey Theatre,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/abbey-theatre-/V0-001-000213946-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

At the end of the workshop the student will have a working Fuzz guitar pedal they can take home with them. After a safety talk, we begin the workshop by providing a comprehensive soldering lesson, where users will learn the correct and safe way to solder. We include how to solder to a circuit board as well as connecting wires together. Following this we begin the build, starting at the stomp switch, followed by the circuit board and other connections. Once everything is soldered together we place everything into a solid aluminium enclosure. As we go through the build we explain what each part of the circuit is for and how it affects the sound. We also introduce the students to the circuit’s schematic and explain how it all works together. No experience required but this workshop is strictly 15+.

Clients love it and so do the practitioners. &quot;I attended the 2 day Kinetic Shift course and the only words I can use to describre this are Amazing, Fantastic and Life Changing . Fabolous weekend, learning so much, building confidence and meeting so many interesting like minded people&quot; Susan Watson &quot;I first attender this course a year ago and all of a sudden it made hypnosis and my therapy business feel &quot;fresh&quot; again Key is the level of particiption, the energy is high and everyone leaves confident to apply the techniques immediately. I recommend this 100%&quot; Matt Gilbert   Kinetic Shift was developed by Karl Smith after years and years of watching and participating in boring and really pathetic hypnotherapy methods, laying the client down and really boring them to death with long-winded scripts or monotone voices. After 2 years of field testing with Military and Emergency Services personnel, he finalised the 7 simplistic stages of Kinetic Shift.  Watch this video of Karl Smith (Founder of UK Hypnosis Academy) and Ivan L. Fernandez (UK Hypnosis Academy Trainer) Hypnotherapy Scripts are great but they should be thrown out at the earliest point in a hypnotherapists career, as they offer little except words and pacing. Which is great, but then you have to develop, and that&#39;s where Kinetic Shift fits in……by Developing Confidence and Speed in a therapist work, also working intuitively with your clients…. making them feel special.Now, what will this technique do? Compared to the Classical lay down and keep quiet Hypnotherapy, It will get the client to participate. Remember Hypnosis is not a state of eyelids…. their eyes can be open, so most of the work in Kinetic Shift is eyes open.Kinetic Shift gets the intuitive part of the therapist into overdrive watching every move, every twitch, every eye movement and emotion the client displays during your session and ensures that by the time they leave you, you the therapist, they will know there life is changed…..its fun!Use the Clients feelings and emotions, use their State ……Work directly with the MIND, Not the Cognitive part of the brain that will lie or cover up.No more….. “I went to a therapist and I laid there and It didn’t work!” With Kinetic Shift, they will know something happened.Kinetic Shift is broken down into 7 stages and will bring your therapy sessions to life, that is a fact! Your clients will love it….WHY? It&#39;s fun and they can feel Kinetic Shift as is happens.With 100’s of people trained in 7 countries (to date) and not one therapist has said, &quot;I can’t use it.&quot; It will bring your sessions to life and WILL bring you more clients…. because the last thing your client will remember is an extraordinary experience and amazing sensation.Kinetic Shift will do 2 things…..Give YOUR client a fun and life-changing session, and also change the way you work and feel in a session, it brings out the passion you have in a therapy room!Describing Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic and Energising. I guarantee you will change the way you work, you will practice, practice, practice and you will have immense fun on this course. &quot;Brilliant. Love it. Would recommend to any therapists. Had so much fun and met some amazing people. I learned so much. Worth every penny. Thank you.&quot; Lorna Cracknell   &quot;If you are in the business of helping people, then you are missing a powerful tool if Kinetic Shift is not yet in your arsenal. The 2 days spent with Karl and his team drive your confidence through the roof as you learn change happens fast and easy. The techniques at not so much taught, but rather installed so that they are second nature by the end.  Make sure you are one of the ones making a rel difference by using Kinetic Shift&quot; Barry Collins This is a two-day course running from 9:30 to 17:30 on day one, and from 9:30 to 17:00 on day two.Certification requires attendance on both days.BOOK YOUR SEAT NOW ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102713097-1,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3430419,,-6.2637154,2017-06-29 04:53:15,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-08-26 09:30:00,,Hypnosis Foundation (Rapid inductions) & Kinetic Shift Technique,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-sh-/E0-001-102713097-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Exchequer Street Dublin 2&nbsp,1,V0-001-001859381-4,The Central Hotel,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-central-hotel-/V0-001-001859381-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Both sides menace and swell, playing with time and space before building to two distinct strains of glorious sonic pay-off. ‘Tough Love’ is released on the illustrious Penske Recordings on Friday 14th July but will be available to purchase at the show.<p>The Jimmy Cake formed as a 10-piece group in Dublin, Ireland in 2000 from the fresh remains of local experimental rock noiseniks Das Madman. In that time they have collaborated live with the likes of Damo Suzuki, Iva Bittova & Charles Hayward while slowly drifting over the course of six albums from a pastoral psychedelia to full-on kosmische psych, fully realised on ‘Master’ their 2015 aural colossus. Drawing from the same sonic palette, Tough Love is another serpentine & ecstatic creation from one of Ireland’s most consistently adventurous bands.</p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103888451-9,[None],53.3466761,,-6.2632464,2017-06-17 19:25:55,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,Dublin 1,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-08 20:00:00,,The Jimmy Cake,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/jimmy-cake-/E0-001-103888451-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,35 Lower Liffey Street,1,V0-001-004645599-7,The Grand Social (Formerly Pravda),http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-grand-social-formerly-pravda-/V0-001-004645599-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Service providers are asked to sign-up to the Charter by completing an inclusion policy for their setting. For reference purposes, an Inclusion Policy template is contained within the Guidelines. To support this process, updated Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Guidelines for Early Childhood Care and Education have been produced and each childcare service should have received a copy. We are now in a position to offer the national training programme on the Inclusion Charter and the Guidelines.

At the end of the workshop the student will have a working Fuzz guitar pedal they can take home with them. After a safety talk, we begin the workshop by providing a comprehensive soldering lesson, where users will learn the correct and safe way to solder. We include how to solder to a circuit board as well as connecting wires together. Following this we begin the build, starting at the stomp switch, followed by the circuit board and other connections. Once everything is soldered together we place everything into a solid aluminium enclosure. As we go through the build we explain what each part of the circuit is for and how it affects the sound. We also introduce the students to the circuit’s schematic and explain how it all works together. No experience required but this workshop is strictly 15+.

1085,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-05-06 03:58:59," Hosted by Ivan Lentijo Fernandez, who is a U.K. Hypnosis Academy Trainer, Kinetic Shift Practitioner and a Hypnotherapist since 2011.Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic, EnergisingKinetic Shift …What is It? And what will it do for you?Kinetic Shift is a rapid method combining several different techniques to resolve Fears, Phobias, Anxiety, Weight Loss, Smoking and even PTSD and much more. We all know that we can’t express everything we want to verbally, so we use several other methods of communication and that is key to Kinetic Shift.Who can use it? Everyone from Beginners to Seasoned therapists….. it&#39;s so simple and fun you can do it anywhere.Sub-modalities, Confusion, Metaphors, Shamanistic, Intuition and Theatrical are what make up Kinetic Shift a complete opposite to the classically trained methods you see….. Clients love it and so do the practitioners. &quot;I attended the 2 day Kinetic Shift course and the only words I can use to describre this are Amazing, Fantastic and Life Changing . Fabolous weekend, learning so much, building confidence and meeting so many interesting like minded people&quot; Susan Watson &quot;I first attender this course a year ago and all of a sudden it made hypnosis and my therapy business feel &quot;fresh&quot; again Key is the level of particiption, the energy is high and everyone leaves confident to apply the techniques immediately. I recommend this 100%&quot; Matt Gilbert   Kinetic Shift was developed by Karl Smith after years and years of watching and participating in boring and really pathetic hypnotherapy methods, laying the client down and really boring them to death with long-winded scripts or monotone voices. After 2 years of field testing with Military and Emergency Services personnel, he finalised the 7 simplistic stages of Kinetic Shift.  Watch this video of Karl Smith (Founder of UK Hypnosis Academy) and Ivan L. Fernandez (UK Hypnosis Academy Trainer) Hypnotherapy Scripts are great but they should be thrown out at the earliest point in a hypnotherapists career, as they offer little except words and pacing. Which is great, but then you have to develop, and that&#39;s where Kinetic Shift fits in……by Developing Confidence and Speed in a therapist work, also working intuitively with your clients…. making them feel special.Now, what will this technique do? Compared to the Classical lay down and keep quiet Hypnotherapy, It will get the client to participate. Remember Hypnosis is not a state of eyelids…. their eyes can be open, so most of the work in Kinetic Shift is eyes open.Kinetic Shift gets the intuitive part of the therapist into overdrive watching every move, every twitch, every eye movement and emotion the client displays during your session and ensures that by the time they leave you, you the therapist, they will know there life is changed…..its fun!Use the Clients feelings and emotions, use their State ……Work directly with the MIND, Not the Cognitive part of the brain that will lie or cover up.No more….. “I went to a therapist and I laid there and It didn’t work!” With Kinetic Shift, they will know something happened.Kinetic Shift is broken down into 7 stages and will bring your therapy sessions to life, that is a fact! Your clients will love it….WHY? It&#39;s fun and they can feel Kinetic Shift as is happens.With 100’s of people trained in 7 countries (to date) and not one therapist has said, &quot;I can’t use it.&quot; It will bring your sessions to life and WILL bring you more clients…. because the last thing your client will remember is an extraordinary experience and amazing sensation.Kinetic Shift will do 2 things…..Give YOUR client a fun and life-changing session, and also change the way you work and feel in a session, it brings out the passion you have in a therapy room!Describing Kinetic Shift in 4 words – Active, Intuitive, Dynamic and Energising. I guarantee you will change the way you work, you will practice, practice, practice and you will have immense fun on this course. &quot;Brilliant. Love it. Would recommend to any therapists. Had so much fun and met some amazing people. I learned so much. Worth every penny. Thank you.&quot; Lorna Cracknell   &quot;If you are in the business of helping people, then you are missing a powerful tool if Kinetic Shift is not yet in your arsenal. The 2 days spent with Karl and his team drive your confidence through the roof as you learn change happens fast and easy. The techniques at not so much taught, but rather installed so that they are second nature by the end.  Make sure you are one of the ones making a rel difference by using Kinetic Shift&quot; Barry Collins This is a two-day course running from 9:30 to 17:30 on day one, and from 9:30 to 17:00 on day two.Certification requires attendance on both days.BOOK YOUR SEAT NOW ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102713097-1,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/476/134-1.png_/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-shif-34.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3430419,,-6.2637154,2017-06-29 04:53:15,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-08-26 09:30:00,,Hypnosis Foundation (Rapid inductions) & Kinetic Shift Technique,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/hypnosis-foundation-rapid-inductions-kinetic-sh-/E0-001-102713097-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Exchequer Street Dublin 2&nbsp,1,V0-001-001859381-4,The Central Hotel,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-central-hotel-/V0-001-001859381-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

A transcendent talent with pedigree and mentorship to match, she was going to be the greatest female vocalist ever. For a time, she was, and then she all-too-publicly fell short.<p> Documentarian Nick Broomfield and iconic music video director Rudi Dolezal offer a never-before-seen backstage look at the height of Houston’s stardom and trace with penetrating detail the forces that contributed to her shortened career and subsequent death in 2012, at age 48. Whether it be racism, religion, drugs, sexuality, self-doubt, gossip, rivalry, insufficient training, the demands of parents and the industry, a troubled marriage playing out in headlines, or the inevitable toll those stresses take from so muscular and passionate a singer, the directors leave nothing unturned. They create a picture of a remarkable woman who needed more help than she received and provide an unflinching, gripping, and wholly committed exploration of talent given and taken away, in an era obsessed with how that talent lives when the stage lights go down.<p>  <p> Filmmaker Rudi Dolezal is a legend on the international music documentary scene, having spent 25 years working with many legendary musicians. He has received two Grammy nominations. Nick Broomfield is an award-winning filmmaker whose work includes Tales of the Grim Sleeper, Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer, and The Leader, His Driver and the Driver&#39;s Wife.<p> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G2fY0xci_c</p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103889451-6,[None],53.3357011,,-6.2568006,2017-06-17 15:30:43,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-12 19:45:00,,Whitney. “Can I Be Me”,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/whitney-can-i-me-/E0-001-103889451-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,8 Lower Leeson St,1,V0-001-000425623-5,Sugarclub,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/sugarclub-/V0-001-000425623-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,
1102,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-12 08:35:17,"Dublin International Piano Festival 2017 is proud to present a magnificent afternoon of music with the one and only Gabriele Baldocci on July 28th. One of the highlights of this year’s program, the chosen pieces reflect the power, passion, and conflict of Tolstoy’s epic 1869 classic.  A renowned conductor, Baldocci has given concerts in a myriad of venues; from Zurich’s Tonhalle and the Parco Della Musica in Rome to the Teatro Fraschini in Pavia. As a pianist, he has been on the bill for festivals in Denmark, Argentina and many more. His performances are regularly broadcast on television and radio, with Italian network Classica producing a documentary about his storied career. His recordings are available on esteemed labels Stradivarius and Dynamic.  This is set to be an unmissable event in the company of the Italian, described by Gramophone Magazine as ‘a pianist of formidable capabilities’. Only  a musician of his calibre would begin a recital with the technically demanding Lizst transcription of Beethoven’s 5th symphony. Composed as the Napoleonic Wars ravaged Europe, Beethoven himself was tormented by increasing deafness during its creation.  Following this tour de force is a piece from the iconic Frenchman, Maurice Ravel. La Valse (The Waltz), was his tribute to the elegance and suggestive sensuality of the Viennese ballroom dance. This hypnotic and thrilling work was also said to be an incisive comment on the chaos in Europe following the Great War.  The closing piece of this event is from Russian great Kabalevsky, who was one of the leading figures in Soviet era classical music. Piano Sonata no. 3 evokes the era of Tolstoy’s masterwork and is the perfect thematic closure to the recital. Piano Sonata no. 3 is one of the most complex of Kabalevsky’s works, and reflects the patriotism and conflict present during a trying period in the country’s history.  The beautiful Hugh Lane Gallery plays host to this unforgettable experience, where the audience will be immersed in a rousing and passionate performance of some outstanding works of art.",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103739312-6,[None],53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-12 08:35:17,Europe/Dublin,pianofestival,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-28 13:00:00,2017-07-28 14:30:00,Gabriele Baldocci | 'War & Peace',,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/gabriele-baldocci-war-peace-/E0-001-103739312-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

The son of a farm labourer, Ledwidge was born in a labourer’s cottage in Slane, Co Meath, and worked as a farm labourer, a miner and a road worker while writing the poems that were starting to bring him fame before he died just before his 30th birthday, having lived to see only one book of his poems in print, which he received while existing of starvation rations in Serbia in the freezing winter of 1914. A committed Irish nationalist, Ledwidge enlisted in the Inniskilling Fusiliers in 1914, endured the slaughter of Gallipoli and was recovering from injuries in a Manchester Hospital when word reached him of the Easter Rising, inspiring his most famous poem for his friend and fellow poet, Thomas MacDonagh.<p><br>The poet, novelist and playwright Dermot Bolger has long been a champion and admirer of the work of Francis Ledwidge. He is the editor of the recently republished <a href=""http://newisland.ie/product/francis-ledwidge-selected-poems/"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external""><strong>Francis Ledwidge: Selected Poem,</strong></a> for which he also wrote a lengthy personal afterword describing the influence of Ledwidge on his own life and work.

1112,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-28 06:23:44," Thematic Overview: ‘Horror is becoming the environmental norm.’ —Sara L. Crosby Gothic and horror fictions have long functioned as vivid reflections of contemporary cultural fears. Wood argues that horror is ‘the struggle for recognition of all that our society represses or oppresses’, and Newman puts forward the idea that it ‘actively eliminates and exorcises our fears by allowing them to be relegated to the imaginary realm of fiction’.  Now, more than ever, the environment has become a locus of those fears for many people, and this conference seeks to investigate the wide range of Gothic- and horror-inflected texts that tackle the darker side of nature. As we inch ever closer toward an anthropogenic ecological crisis, this type of fiction demands our attention. In 2009, Simon Estok highlighted the importance of ‘ecophobia’ in representations of nature, emphasising the need for ecocriticism to acknowledge the ‘irrational and groundless hatred of the natural world’ present in contemporary society. Tom J. Hillard responded to Estok’s call ‘to talk about how fear of the natural world is a definable and recognizable discourse’, suggesting that ‘we need look no further than the rich and varied vein of critical approaches used to investigate fear in literature.’ What happens, he asks, ‘when we bring the critical tools associated with Gothic fiction to bear on writing about nature?’ Gothic Nature seeks to address this question, interrogating the place of non-human nature in horror and the Gothic today, and showcasing the most exciting and innovative research currently being conducted in the field. We are especially interested in papers/panels which address ecocritical theory and endeavour to define and discern the distinctions between ‘ecohorror’ and ‘ecogothic’. We welcome academic papers from a variety of different subject backgrounds, as well as interdisciplinary work. Additionally, we also encourage creative submissions from artists and performers whose work intersects with these themes, and hope to provide a platform for a variety of print and performance art at the conference. Confirmed Keynotes: Dr William Hughes (Bath Spa University) and Dr Jenny Bavidge (Cambridge University). Additional Information: Your conference ticket covers both days of this two-day interdisciplinary and international conference, entry to an introductory talk and live reading of a new production of Bram Stoker&#39;s Dracula, and admittance to the wine reception on the Saturday evening.

1121,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-06 10:26:06," Presented by Rub A Dub Hi-Fi and The Big Blue Bus with special thanks to Saoirse Sounds. Johnny Osbourne is a veteran artist who has been recording hits since the 1970s and is well-known to Reggae lovers worldwide for his beautiful melodies, conscious lyrics and crucial dubplates from the 80s and 90s which have left hundreds of soundboys weeping. This is a gig not to be missed at any cost Johnny Osbourne&#39;s voice is a soundtrack to the history of Reggae music and a crucial link to the foundation of Soundsystem Culture. Johnny Osbourne attended the Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica that also was home to Yellowman, founding members of the Skatalites, Leroy Smart and Leroy Horsemouth Wallace as well as Jazz men Dizzy Reece and Joe Harriott. During 1967 Osbourne became lead vocalist of The Wildcats, and recorded for producer Winston Riley, although nothing was issued. The Wildcats&#39; manager then financed a session at Coxsone Dodd&#39;s Studio One, from which his debut single, &quot;All I Have Is Love&quot;, was released. In 1969 he recorded an album, Come Back Darling, again for Riley. On the day that he completed the album, Osbourne emigrated to Toronto, Canada, to join his family. After singing with various soul and reggae groups, he became lead vocalist for Ishan People, and recorded two albums with them. The group broke up in 1979, and Osbourne decided to return to Jamaica. Shortly after returning, he recorded &quot;Forgive Them&quot; and &quot;Jealousy, Heartache And Pain&quot; for the Studio One label. Through late 1979 and early 1980 he recorded extensively for Dodd, with these sessions culminating in Truths And Rights. In 1979 he also had a hit for King Jammy (then Prince Jammy) with &quot;Folly Ranking&quot;, and an album of the same name followed in 1980. The success of these recordings made him one of the most in-demand vocalists on the island, and a glut of material was released, including Fally Lover, Warrior, Innah Disco Style and Never Stop Fighting, between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, he began the year with two big hits, &quot;Yo Yo&quot; and &quot;Lend Me A Chopper&quot;, and later in the year enjoyed further success with &quot;Water Pumping&quot;, an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis&#39; &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, which had also served as the basis for Johnny Clarke&#39;s 1976 hit &quot;Rockers Time Now&quot;. The hits continued with &quot;Get Cracking&quot;, &quot;Check For You&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; (1984), &quot;Buddy Bye&quot;, &quot;No Sound Like We&quot; and &quot;In The Area&quot; (1985). In the late 1980s he was particularly successful when recording for Bobby Digital, and had hits with &quot;Good Time Rock&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rude Boy Skank&quot; (1988), both of which are included on his 1989 album, Rougher Than Them. Throughout the 1980s he continued to record for Coxsone Dodd, and singles included &quot;Keep That Light&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;A We Run Things&quot;, but a long-promised second album from Dodd has not materialized. ______________________________________________________________________ Tickets €20 available from Eventbrite and the Big Blue Bus in the Bernard Shaw and at festivals across the country.

Now in its fifth year the Secure Computing Forum is Ireland’s largest conference dedicated to cyber security and provides a platform aimed at fostering dialogue amongst key security players in Ireland. Cybercrime has changed the world of enterprise security and how networks and organisations are attacked. As cyber threats increase in sophistication targeting both people and companies, organisations must evolve to remain one step ahead of the threats.  These threats, and the cyber-criminals behind them, are experts at remaining hidden from traditional security while exhibiting an intelligence, resiliency and patience never been seen before. Leading industry experts will focus on key areas including: Taking Control of your Cyber Security Protecting and Defending Against Cyber Threats in Uncertain Times Fighting Ransomware and Cyber Extortion Securing the Internet of Things (IOT) - What is the Real Risk for Enterprise Cyber Security? Making Sense of the EU GDPR Artificial Intelligence - The Latest Threat and Defence in the Cyber Security War Cloud Security - Your Data, Your Responsibility Our speakers on the day include cybersecurity journalist and author Misha Glenny, Chairman of Cyber Essentials Direct and former MP David Blunkett, and many more yet to be announced.  ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102497827-3,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/395/493-5.jpeg_/secure-computing-forum-2017-93.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.334178,,-6.228969,2017-06-28 04:11:26,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,4,1,,D,Dublin,2017-09-21 09:00:00,,Secure Computing Forum 2017,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/secure-computing-forum-2017-/E0-001-102497827-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,62 Lansdowne Road,1,V0-001-000223394-8,Aviva Stadium,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/aviva-stadium-/V0-001-000223394-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

PRESENTER:  Kevin Baskerville, Leicestershire Autism Outreach Service Manager, Lead for East Midlands Hub for AET (Autism Education Trust)AsFAN is delighted to have Kevin deliver this important workshop.Kevin is the Leicestershire Autism Outreach Service (AOS) Manager and developed a program AOS (Intensive Support) in order to work with students who find accessing mainstream education a significant challenge.  He likes to use a variety of multimedia approaches (so that you’re not just listening to someone speak!!!) and has a role-play free-zone!!! Kevin incorporates information from young people with ASD to help shape and inform practice.As the pressures increase on our children, more and more children with ASD become school refusers.  In this interactive workshop, we look at the reasons why children may refuse to attend school, we explore ways to keep our children within school but then strategies and approaches to use to ease them back.Discussions will take place around ways to use Special Interests, developing Neuro-harmony amongst students (and staff), developing Child Centered Planning systems to help children look at possibilities but also looking at what the community, the family and the educational establishment needs to do to build confidence for all.At the end of this workshop participants will have seen: approaches that are having positive impacts elsewhere and therefore had been involved in discussions on how to make this work locally a variety of strategies and resources used to build trust, confidence in young people with ASD important tools to measure practice, progression and competency in order for establishments to be able to see where they are and what they need to do.

1135,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-06 10:26:06," Presented by Rub A Dub Hi-Fi and The Big Blue Bus with special thanks to Saoirse Sounds. Johnny Osbourne is a veteran artist who has been recording hits since the 1970s and is well-known to Reggae lovers worldwide for his beautiful melodies, conscious lyrics and crucial dubplates from the 80s and 90s which have left hundreds of soundboys weeping. This is a gig not to be missed at any cost Johnny Osbourne&#39;s voice is a soundtrack to the history of Reggae music and a crucial link to the foundation of Soundsystem Culture. Johnny Osbourne attended the Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in Kingston, Jamaica that also was home to Yellowman, founding members of the Skatalites, Leroy Smart and Leroy Horsemouth Wallace as well as Jazz men Dizzy Reece and Joe Harriott. During 1967 Osbourne became lead vocalist of The Wildcats, and recorded for producer Winston Riley, although nothing was issued. The Wildcats&#39; manager then financed a session at Coxsone Dodd&#39;s Studio One, from which his debut single, &quot;All I Have Is Love&quot;, was released. In 1969 he recorded an album, Come Back Darling, again for Riley. On the day that he completed the album, Osbourne emigrated to Toronto, Canada, to join his family. After singing with various soul and reggae groups, he became lead vocalist for Ishan People, and recorded two albums with them. The group broke up in 1979, and Osbourne decided to return to Jamaica. Shortly after returning, he recorded &quot;Forgive Them&quot; and &quot;Jealousy, Heartache And Pain&quot; for the Studio One label. Through late 1979 and early 1980 he recorded extensively for Dodd, with these sessions culminating in Truths And Rights. In 1979 he also had a hit for King Jammy (then Prince Jammy) with &quot;Folly Ranking&quot;, and an album of the same name followed in 1980. The success of these recordings made him one of the most in-demand vocalists on the island, and a glut of material was released, including Fally Lover, Warrior, Innah Disco Style and Never Stop Fighting, between 1980 and 1982. In 1983, he began the year with two big hits, &quot;Yo Yo&quot; and &quot;Lend Me A Chopper&quot;, and later in the year enjoyed further success with &quot;Water Pumping&quot;, an adaptation of Hopeton Lewis&#39; &quot;Take It Easy&quot;, which had also served as the basis for Johnny Clarke&#39;s 1976 hit &quot;Rockers Time Now&quot;. The hits continued with &quot;Get Cracking&quot;, &quot;Check For You&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; (1984), &quot;Buddy Bye&quot;, &quot;No Sound Like We&quot; and &quot;In The Area&quot; (1985). In the late 1980s he was particularly successful when recording for Bobby Digital, and had hits with &quot;Good Time Rock&quot; (1988) and &quot;Rude Boy Skank&quot; (1988), both of which are included on his 1989 album, Rougher Than Them. Throughout the 1980s he continued to record for Coxsone Dodd, and singles included &quot;Keep That Light&quot;, &quot;Unity&quot; and &quot;A We Run Things&quot;, but a long-promised second album from Dodd has not materialized. ______________________________________________________________________ Tickets €20 available from Eventbrite and the Big Blue Bus in the Bernard Shaw and at festivals across the country.

WHY MEDITATE? Many of us are living busy lives and tend to often be in our heads with a constant stream of thoughts. We often forget to check in with ourselves, to be present and aware of whom we truly are.  Meditation can help you to: ~ manage stress ~ be happier ~ be healthier ~ be present ~ be more focussed ~ create inner peace ~ sleep better Structure of the Meditation Classes: Each class is run as a complete meditation practice and will include discussion of the practices, guided meditations, and contemplation. The practices used aim to create balance between body and mind. The classes are open to everyone who is interested in meditation, whether you are a complete beginner or have experience with meditation. Japanese Meditation Practices: The meditation practices used in these classes are based on the Japanese Energetic System, also called The Three Diamonds. The focus is on three energy centres, the Hara (belly), the head and the heart. In Japanese meditation practices the body-mind connection is central: the techniques used help you to get out of your head and bring your awareness back into your body. This helps focus the mind and helps you to become more grounded and present. The techniques used are characterised by simplicity. Elements we work with include utilising breath, Ki (energy) cultivation and awareness, precepts (way of being). Practical Info No need to bring anything. Just wear comfortable clothing (lockers and changing facilities are available). When you arrive, please ring the bell marked “studios”. The class is in Studio 2 on the first floor. Please arrive on time or a few minutes early so meditations will not be interrupted. The classes are led by Tessa van Keeken of Lift Your Spirit, an experienced meditation teacher. She also is a qualified Holistic Therapist, Life Coach, NLP Practitioner and Reiki Master & Teacher.

They call it transatlantic soul.<p>A cross genre multi-instrumentalist, Niall, the songwriter and frontman, grew up on Clare Island off the coast of County Mayo. The insularity of growing up on an island has had a profound effect on his song-writing and thinking in general. He feels that  “the physical isolation tends to make you think more outwardly and look for connections with the wider world.”<p><p>The rest of the band comprises of Hugh Dillon on electric guitar, Dave Duffy on bass and Davie Ryan on drums. Musically, the band share a very coherent outlook having played together in various groups over the last five years including Jazz quartets and Big-Band Soul outfits.<p>Steadfast in developing a solid style that displays the musical skills of each member, the band are motivated by the simplicity of playing ‘for the song’.<p>The band released their album Part of the Light in March 2014 to critical acclaim. Featured as Radio One’s Album of the Week and played extensively across national radio. The band followed national touring with live performances on The Saturday Night Show and Radio One along with a sold out headlining show at The Westport Arts Festival.<p><br><strong>TICKETS</strong><br><br><p>€12 available online from <a href=""http://www.whelanslive.com/index.php/wav-tickets"" rel=""nofollow"">WAV Tickets</a> or Lo-Call <a rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"" rel=""external"">1890 200 078</a> (1-7pm M-F)<p>– 50c per ticket service charge applies on phone, internet or creditcard bookings.

The debut album by Chico Science & Nação Zumbi came out in April 1994. The album was a milestone brought about by a group of friends, that, by creating a new scene, kick-started a musical movement that ultimately destabilised the axis of musical production in Brazil. Like other Recife bands, their intent was express the sound of the local trait ‘crabs with brains’, or the ‘mud parabolics’, and everything else that people know, feel, or relate to with the Manguebeat sound. The difference is that this band, from the outskirts of Recife became known worldwide, far more than any other.<br> Thousands of steps and different places later, what was their leitmotiv now is in their essence. Today, the band evoke the Manguebeat but also bring other sounds to life, a harvest tilled for so many years. No wonder the Nação Zumbi is, until this day, one of the most influential and respected Brazilian bands ever.<p>Produced by:<br> Tropical Lab<br> BOSSA FM – www.bossafm.com<br> Backstage Productions</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-104089799-6,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/811/055-4.jpeg_/277-nao-zumbi-55.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/811/055-4.jpeg_/277-nao-zumbi-55.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/811/055-4.jpeg_/277-nao-zumbi-55.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/811/055-4.jpeg_/277-nao-zumbi-55.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3448904,,-6.2645376,2017-06-25 16:59:09,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,2,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-27 00:00:00,,27/7 Nação Zumbi,,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/277-nao-zumbi-/E0-001-104089799-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,"Curved Street, Temple Bar",1,V0-001-000667957-3,Button Factory,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/button-factory-/V0-001-000667957-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

Has Appalachian flourishes but owes as much to clever pop songwriting as rootsier influences” – <strong>R2 magazine</strong></em><p><em> </em><p><em>“Fabulous songwriting and spine-tingling harmony vocals” – <strong>CMP Magazine</strong></em><p><p><strong>Worry Dolls</strong> are a tenacious songwriting duo born out of the joint talents of <strong>Zoe Nicol</strong> and <strong>Rosie Jones</strong>, who met in Liverpool when they were 18, both on their chosen path of becoming solo singer songwriters, and both falling under the spell of ‘O Brother, Where Art Thou?’. Rosie joined Zoe’s band as a mandolin player and backing vocalist and their great chemistry and love of harmony led to them starting a contemporary bluegrass band playing Nickel Creek, Alison Krauss & Gillian Welch songs together. Paired by their teachers for an opportunity to have their songwriting critiqued by Paul McCartney, they were inspired to start co-writing, and could now be described as an almost telepathically linked songwriting force.<p><p>The pair were drawn to London, where they spent the best part of a year sleeping on couches, obsessively co-writing and performing, and all the while developing a burgeoning cult following. Worry Dolls harnessed this period of transition and channeled it into two EPs, with their second release “Burden” evidencing a sound that was beginning to shed its starry-eyed innocence, and give way to a more acerbic and mature artistic voice.<p><p><strong>‘Bless Your Heart’</strong> is the first single taken from their 2017 debut album, co-written with <strong>Wild Ponies.</strong> It was the first song they wrote in Nashville. They’d been in town for a couple of days and were picking up the southern slang, including “Bless Your Heart” – which they were told can be used to point out to someone that they are being a complete idiot. The highly anticipated debut album <strong>“Get Gone”</strong> was released through <strong>Bread and Butter Records</strong> in early 2017.<p><p>Worry Dolls tour throughout February, March and April 2017 promoting their debut album, with some incredible showcases already completed at the AMA’s Moth Club Showcase and London Fashion week with Vogue.

Yorkston Thorne Khan have released two albums on Domino Records, with Rolling Stone calling 2017’s <strong>Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars</strong> – <em>‘</em><em>a game-changing masterpiece’</em><em>   </em><p><em><strong>Yorkston Thorne Khan</strong></em><em> began life when Suhail Yusuf Khan met James Yorkston backstage at a small festival show in Edinburgh. They got talking about music and their respective instruments and began jamming together there and then. They enjoyed it so much, they decided to take the backstage spontaneity onto the stage that very evening. Suhail and James became firm friends and after this would hook up for shows whenever Suhail was in the UK. Finally, in 2015, they recorded their debut album <strong>‘Everything Sacred’</strong>, with James bringing in his buddy Jon Thorne on double bass. “</em><em>There’s a power in a trio</em><em>” says Jon – “</em><em>You can hear yourself internally, of course, and then there’s an ear each for the other two. Perfect</em><em>”</em><p><em>Since then, YTK have gone on to play GreenMan, Field Day, Sea Change, Edinburgh International Festival, Latitude, Glastonbury and tour in India, Ireland, Spain and the UK.

Until now perhaps, for this inspired Yorkston Thorne Khan teaming operates within a similarly eclectic and free-wheeling orbit”</em><br>★★★★ <strong>The Guardian</strong> <em>“Bravely original Indian-folk-jazz fusion”</em><p>Their second<strong>, ‘Neuk Wight Delhi All-Stars’</strong>, has been received equally well. Released by Domino on April 7<sup>th</sup> 2017, it represents a confluence of currents, among them the north Indian sarangi; jazz-tinged bass, reminiscent in places of Danny Thompson; acoustic guitar that owes a debt to Elizabeth Cotton, Dick Gaughan and Mississippi John Hurt; and three very different vocalists. The combination is unusual: YTK’s Everything Sacred, released in 2016, may be the only precedent.

Students must have an up to date anti tetanus vaccine. Students must be insured by their school. Students should show interest in the charity and we appreciate students who are Junior Members and give them first priority.   To apply for a place for the Gaisce Awards please click here.     Please Note - We do not take on students doing one day a week   The DSPCA, Ireland’s oldest and largest animal rescue shelter is delighted to be able to offer work experience placements to students in Secondary Schools as part of their Transition Year or LCA. Due to our extensive programme, we can only accommodate students wishing to do at least one week’s work experience, i.e. Monday to Friday, and cannot offer placements to those wishing to carry out their An Gaisce service or to those students&#39; wishing to do one day per week over a period of time. This is due to the fact that we believe anything less than a week is of no benefit to either the student or the animals in our care. As you can imagine, places at the shelter are limited, and we advise all students who are interested to apply as soon as possible if they wish to secure a placement during the academic year. We have found that many schools choose the same weeks, thus increasing demand. Unfortunately we cannot take students suffering from animal hair allergies as the placement requires working in confined spaces with multiple dogs and cats. All students must have an up to date anti tetanus vaccination and school insurance certification.

1257,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-04-18 12:45:54," Developmental Attunement, Relational-Needs and Therapeutic Presence A one-day training workshop at Dublin on Relational Psychotherapy with Dr Richard G. Erskine DUBLIN, 13 NOVEMBER 2017, MONDAY 10:00 – 17:00  “The healing of cumulative neglects, traumas, and attachment disruptions occurs through a contactful therapeutic relationship” A contact-oriented and Relational psychotherapy through inquiry, attunement and involvement responds to the client’s current needs for an emotionally nurturing relationship that is reparative and sustaining. The aim of such therapy is the integration of the affect-laden experiences and an intrapsychic reorganization of the client’s beliefs about self and others while acknowledging, validating and normalizing the client’s essential relational needs. As therapists, how do we allow affective, behavioural, cognitive and physiological dimensions to inform our therapeutic direction while effectively interpreting whether ego state regression, activation of the intrapsychic influence of introjection and presence of defence mechanisms are indications of contact deficits that seek fulfilment? At this unique and practical training workshop, Dr Richard Erskine draws on an integrative therapeutic approach and explains Relational Psychotherapy as a process of making whole: taking disowned, unaware, unresolved aspects of the ego and making them part of the cohesive self. He especially highlights how ‘developmental attunement’ is key to this reparative process – through which, we as therapists can sensitise our therapeutic responses to a client’s regression, while remaining aware that such regression allows clients to access defended memories and experience otherwise forbidden affect. Through lecture, case vignettes, videos & therapy demonstrations and clinical discussions, the workshop helps us comprehend a series of psychotherapeutic methods that include: the creation of interpersonal contact; the formation of a healing relationship;  the therapeutic use of phenomenological inquiry; the relational centrality of attunement to the client’s affects and rhythm; the timing of relational-inquiry; the significance of resonating with the client’s level of emotional development; the affirming use of acknowledgement, validation, and normalization; the distinction between a reactive and responsive countertransference; the centrality of therapeutic presence Keeping in mind the therapeutic challenges we face as psychotherapists, psychologists, counsellors and psychiatrists, Richard describes the Eight Relational-Needs essential for human development and wellbeing. He focusses on the centrality of an involved therapeutic relationship while emphasizing the in-depth methods of a psychotherapy that integrates the client&#39;s affect, cognition, physiology and behaviour.  © nscience UK ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-102222161-2,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/327/301-6.png_/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-thera-01.png', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3394027,,-6.2614196,2017-06-24 04:50:35,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-11-13 10:00:00,,"Developmental Attunement, Relational-Needs and Therapeutic Presence",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/developmental-attunement-relationalneeds-and-the-/E0-001-102222161-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,128 Saint Stephen's Green,1,V0-001-006930808-7,The Fitzwilliam Hotel,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/the-fitzwilliam-hotel-/V0-001-006930808-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,

1264,0,,,Dublin,,IRL,IE,Ireland,2017-06-15 23:25:07," https://youtu.be/rIaZ8QnmdOc A piano recital like you’ve never witnessed before will take place on July 23rd at the Hugh Lane Gallery, as part of The Dublin International Piano Festival 2017. Acclaimed pianist and master tutor of the Deeper Piano Studies method, Frederic Chiu brings you an exhilarating twist on a piano recital - Frenchman Claude Debussy with his dreamy, impressionistic technique and use of the Lydian mode, versus the percussive virtuosity of Prokofiev. Two composers who couldn’t be on more opposite ends of the scale, from an era where concert music was high-stakes, spirit-stirring stuff. Who will you choose? This thrilling show is not your average piano recital, the audience will be engaged and excited, and perhaps their loyalties will be tested. From Debussy’s Rêverie to Prokofiev’s Toccata and everything in between, this promises to be a fantastic, fun-filled music experience for all ages. Over the course of the festival, some lucky music students from our Summer Academy will also get the chance to learn under Chiu’s acclaimed teaching program, Deeper Piano Studies. The method has been presented at the Juilliard School and the Banff centre among other prestigious institutions of study. The novel approach to piano teaching includes learning collaboration and competition through cooking challenges and sensory games, and has been widely acclaimed. Influenced by greats like Glenn Gould and Vladimir Horowitz from a young age, Chiu has performed in esteemed venues like the Kennedy Centre in Washington, The Chatelet in Paris and the iconic Lincoln Centre in New York. He frequently collaborates on various vibrant live piano experiences with musicians like Joshua Bell, Bob James and Pierre Amoyal to name but a few. Chiu has released over 27 recordings, including the most extensive, complete piano works of Prokofiev, Chopin, Liszt, Ravel, Mendelssohn among other classical geniuses.  ",EVDB Geocoder,,,,E0-001-103827801-9,"[{'medium': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '128', 'height': '128'}, 'thumb': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}, 'caption': None, 'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'height': '48', 'width': '48', 'small': {'url': 'http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/038/743/807-3.jpeg_/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smackd-07.jpeg', 'width': '48', 'height': '48'}}]",53.3543955,,-6.2652603,2017-06-23 21:38:03,Europe/Dublin,evdb,,,1,,D,Dublin,2017-07-23 12:00:00,,"Concert #2 of 6 | Frederic Chiu, piano | 'Classical Smackdown: Debussy vs. Prokofiev'",,,,,http://dublin.eventful.com/events/concert-2-6-frederic-chiu-piano-classical-smac-/E0-001-103827801-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,Charlemont House,1,V0-001-000721660-9,Dublin City Gallery The Hugh Lane,http://dublin.eventful.com/venues/dublin-city-gallery-the-hugh-lane-/V0-001-000721660-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic,
